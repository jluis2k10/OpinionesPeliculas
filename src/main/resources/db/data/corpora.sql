When I learned that Zack Snyder had his fingers in it I got a worried since he recently wrote such atrocities as Batman vs Superman and sure enough the story is a really the weakest part of the movie. A typical nonsensical, unintelligent, Hollywood story/script were you are better off putting your brain in idle when watching it.

However it makes up for this with cool special effects and, surprisingly, quite enjoyable characters. This is definitely a movie that you watch for the sake of the special effects. Well, if you are a male teenager you might also be watching it to drool over Gal Gadot of course (I have to admit that she is hot).

There is not too much to say about the plot. Our Amazon hot chick discovers that there is a war going on and goes out to stop it. Since she has been overly protected by her guardian she is amazingly clueless about life outside of her little island. Especially aspects involving men. Something which creates some funny moments as well as some embarrassingly silly ones. This, Diana’s gradual evolution where she not only is learning about life but also discovers her considerable powers, is one of the enjoyable aspects of the movie though. It is of course also one of the dummer aspects of the movie. How the f… could the Amazon Queen race Diana to be so ignorant about everything?

Another not so enjoyable part of the movie is the ludicrous scenes where the britts are trying to obtain peace at all costs as well as the stereotypical portrayal of Ludendorff as some megalomaniacal, half crazy war-mongerer. This was just dumb. I guess Zac Snyder just picked the name out of some history book without bothering to read up on the character. Typical lack of intelligence and respect, a la Hollywood, for anything outside of their, very limited, sphere of knowledge.
Well, at least Danny Huston did a pretty decent job of the shitty role he was given. So did most of the rest of actors. I definitely liked Gal Gadot as Super Woman but then, although I am not a teenager, I am still a male so maybe I am biased when it comes to her?

I definitely liked the special effects. The showdown at the end was great as far as I am concerned and the rest not bad either. They could have been even better though if it would not have been so obvious that the Germans where mostly incompetent extras waiting for Wonder Woman to show off her gymnastics and slow motion abilities. Come on, even superhero special effects should make some pretense of being “realistic�? superhero special effects.

The movie is definitely aimed at the young adult segment. Unfortunately it do not seem to know what it is aiming for. Sometimes it is almost adult, sometimes it is late teen and sometimes just so bloody TV-show silly that you’re wondering if it is aiming for even pre-teens.

Anyway, regardless of its faults I did enjoy my 2+ hour spent on this movie.

Actually, come to think of it, it''s not beyond me. I wouldn''t put it past studios to use spam accounts and fake reviews to build up something that simply isn''t there. It''s a shame cause the appearance of WW in BvS was one of the highlights of that movie, she held her own next to the Bat and Superman and left people hoping she''ll do the same in her stand alone movie.

She doesn''t.

The only aspects of the movie that resonated was Diana''s ignorance of the world beyond her home. Peeling the veil beyond the idyllic world she was raised in with the cold harsh reality of the real world offered an abundance of opportunities to explore her character, the world as it was at the time and social topics that are still very relevant. Why is mankind self destructive, can we change and most importantly, equality of sexes. The movie drops the ball on all of them by either reducing those aspects to trivial scenes designed to invoke a cheap giggle or overly dramatic cliche ridden contrived moments that make you roll your eyes.

Although it looks good enough, screenplay, directing and pacing are all over the place. Save one action scene that takes place on the western front and has some structure to it (btw, that''s also one of the few moments a genuine moral and emotional conflict is brought up but like the rest of the movie left unfulfilled) actions scenes are typical present day CGI fests, nothing unseen.

What wraps up the beating of the dead horse are Pine''s acting chops that only serve to highlight Gadot''s lack thereof. This otherwise lovely and charming lady was in plenty of movies in recent years, some of the franchises were quite successful (unfortunately), but there was always a reason she never took off. You''ll call me sexist and whatnot but something tells me I''m not the first nor the last one to notice her lack of talent. Putting someone like her next to Connie Nielsen, Robin Wright, Chris Pine, Danny Houston, even Ewen Bremner and Elena Anaya with their limited screen time, she simply can''t hold her own.

All those things added up result with a mediocre movie that''s been hyped beyond belief to go along with the current climate of appeasement and send a "strong woman" message. They should have taken some hints from the Bride, Ellen Ripley, Sarah Connor or the like. They had talented actresses playing well written characters, none of which is present in WW.

Anyways, that''s where I''m at with this mess.

I''m a fan of all the Marvel series, but this is just a slap in the face to all the fans. How it got above a 5 on IMDB is beyond me.

1) The plot. Just dumb.
2) The A-team. What was their purpose? Comical relief? WW did everything herself. They were introduced with the assumption that each had some special skill that they can contribute. If terrible singing and hitting on women is a skill, any average drunk could have been part of this team. And what the hell is up with the indian?  He''s the whitest indian I''ve ever seen.
3) Lazy script writing. At one scene WW loses her sword. Next scene she has the sword while Aries patiently waited for her to retrieve it. Seriously?
4) Why did Steve need to fly the plane at the end to blow it and himself up? They could have just blown it up where it was to begin with. No need to sacrifice himself. As much destruction that Aries brought to that area, the extra explosion from the plane would not have made a difference.
5) For being super fighters, the Amazon women died pretty fast from bullets. So basically they have no special abilities and are just some hot women that can shoot arrows.
6) After Aries dies, everyone is hugging and the war is over. But we all know that there are plenty of other wars in the future. So that didn''t make any sense at all.
7) The A-team was fighting a sniper and risked their lives to pick up and lift a heavy piece of metal to make WW jump in the air to destroy the enemy sniper. As much destruction as she can deal, she did not need their help to jump an extra two feet.
8) For being a god, Aries got his ass kicked by WW. The fight should have been more evenly matched.
9) Acting. WW is hot. That''s it. She''s a terrible actress in this movie.

First of all, this movie only made money because it''s a superhero movie, don''t get me wrong, I love superhero movies and i wanted to like Wonder Woman, but I just can''t get aboard the hype train.

**Here''s why this movie sucks on its own merits:**

Movie part:

-For a superhero movie the CGI was horribly bad (they were also poorly edited). It is so obvious. I kept wondering if this movie was made in the early 2000''s!!!
How poorly can such an expensive movie use such bad camera angles in front of something as simple as a green screen? and every action scene was in slow motions! you can''t do that!!!

-The first half of the movie was sooo slow I had to hold my eyes open to prevent me from falling asleep, then the rest i couldn''t make sense of the movie and I really don''t think the writers knew either.
Wonder Woman stumbles through the movie like a naive 15 year old imbecile who hasn''t hit puberty yet., she''s a goddess for crying out loud (I know they tried to make it obvious she was a stranger to the World she just entered, but for love og Gods they didn''t have to make her stupid!!), [spoiler] the logic for not telling her who she really is, screwed up the movie . The way she kills Ares at the end, could have been achieved by telling her who she really was earlier, [/spoiler] granted, it would have been a short movie but better.

-And me-Wow, she can talk different languages such superhero powers very amazing!
I don''t get why they tried to make it so obvious, they could have focused on something else.

-i didn''t get why they had to show different races so obviously i mean, come on skirt, hat,... Are we 8?

Gal Gadot part:

-First of all, she was not a good choice for WW,  physically amazon ladies are not stick thin models surviving on a lettuce leaf diet.
and i dont get why everyone was praising the "Israeli actress" ,She had this weird accent and when she talked, she did this extra head movement which looked ridiculous. also bad bad acting oh my god.

-It seemed like Gal Gadot was constantly posing for a photo shoot instead of acting!!
I don’t know if it was all the feminists that boosted the rating of this movie, if it was… that’s extremely sad.


Logic/mythology:

[spoiler] -WW''s aunt sacrifices her life so that WW doesn''t get shot from behind early in the movie. Later in the movie the villain tells her she''s a god and only a god can kill a god. This renders her aunt''s sacrifice an act of suicide because the movie went out of its way to tell the audience that all the Amazon Women knew she was a god. [/spoiler]

[spoiler] -WW''s mom, the queen, tells everyone not to do something only to have everyone disobey her. Not just once, but EVERY time she says don''t do something, someone does exactly the opposite. I.E. Don''t train my daughter to fight, don''t let this guy leave the island, don''t go with the guy leaving the island. [/spoiler]

[spoiler] -Zeus creates the Amazons to defeat Ares. In actual mythology, the tribe of Amazons were the offspring of, wait for it.... Ares and Harmonia - a nymph. So, Ares is WW''s father, not brother. Yup!
Then Zeus, creates a child of his to serve as a weapon against Ares to save mankind, Wonder Women. Really? [/spoiler] This sounds odd and forced in a Greek setting.

Humor:

-They dedicated a continuous 15-20 min segment and it all stems from the cultural differences between the Amazonians and humans. The bath scene (**Average man!** if only this part was done by a woman and we had all hell broke loose), sleeping in the boat, the secretary, the clothes trials... all stems from the same issue. It''s the same material stretched for 15 mins

Music:
Not bad. Not memorable either. in other word,  Meh.


**Overall, this is a bad movie, made not to entertain but a quick money maker with main selling point: "Female Lead". Very overrated.
This movie could have been something amazing, something that had new things to say, shame it didn''t.**', 'ACED00057372000D6A6176612E74696D652E536572955D84BA1B2248B20C00007870770A05000007E109060428CD78', null, 0, -125542209, 0.983739951983235, 0.00000016169149568215765, 'SUBJECTIVE', 0.9999173980002416, 'NEGATIVE', 0.983739951983235, 0.016259886325269226, 'Trakt', 'https://trakt.tv/comments/140276', 1);

What pissed me off the most was that I came into this thinking it was a good movie. It has a good rating on here, and IMDb. I should have read the user reviews first, they are almost all negative (on IMDb). Within the first 15 minutes I found myself being shocked by bad CGI and later by a story that really never gets off the ground.

Everyone was praising the Israeli actress for her excellent portrayal of Wonder Woman. I thought she was subpar at best. This movie could have been great, but it simply wasn’t.

I''m actually quite surprised by this, but glad at the same time. DC didn''t have such a great start with it''s previous installments and while I''m still anxious about the next upcoming films, I can safely say that "Wonder Woman" is the first decent film in the DC Universe.

The two stand outs of the film are Gal Gadot and Chris Pine. Both the chemistry and the performances were all solid. You love seeing them together and hate to see something bad come between them, which always ends tragically. I wasn''t a huge fan of Gal Gadot performance and character in "Batman V Superman", as it didn''t fit in the already crowed movie and isn''t in the best hands. Here it''s better in terms of direction.

"Wonder Woman" is a massive improvement and am very happy DC listened. The action scenes were exciting and well made. It''s colorful and has a great message for empowerment for both women &amp; men. Without the painfully obvious re-shoots and no Kanye West songs or Queen Bohemian Rhapsody thrown in for "improvements". The movie is at least watchable and enjoyable. And get this, it''s got a sense of humor, even when some of it didn''t hit the mark.

While I liked the movie overall, however I didn''t quite love it like everyone else. My issues are with the first act being sluggish and filled with cliche digoule. Soon as Chris Pine shows up is when it picked up for me, as you get some great scenes between Steve and Diana.

The film had a great message about war and how everyone is a mix of good and bad; which sadly gets ruined in the third act and turns into "Man of Steel" climax all over again. Pretty disappointing. And I didn''t like Wonder Woman theme (which is rock music) playing while the story is set in WW1. It just felt odd and out of place hearing rock music during that type of era, but that''s my opinion.

I don''t know who does the visual effects for the DC movies, because it doesn''t look that good and very unfinished. I mean, some of it looked decent when it''s not against real life environment, although that can''t be said for the rest.

The movie also suffers from the same problem with Marvel and that''s the villains. Talk about cartoonist at it''s worse and just stereotypical. Just be glad it isn''t as bad as enchantress.

Overall rating: Wow, it may look like I named off more problems than positives. Keep in mind I really did like the movie, these are just things that bugged me and could have done better. The rest I thought was good and I''m interested in where things are going in the future for these movies.

--- I am sad Steve had to pass on in the first film but it was done in such a heroic way that it helped the sting.
David Thewlis was great as Ares but hopefully his form is able to change in the future since the armour was intimidating but as soon as the helmet was gone well..David doesn''t have that factor.

We have the forgettable side-character #1 that is only here for comic relief, #2 that''s only there to make the protagonist question her loyalty and #3 with a troubled past that the protagonist can help overcome.
And of course the german bad guys played by non-germans speaking in english with a ridiculous -- what they think ought to pass as a -- german accent. Here is the thing: germans don''t speak with other germans in english with a distinct german fake accent. Let them speak german and add subtitles (ugh, reading...) or let them speak normal english.

Admittedly, I don''t know much about Patty Jenkins except that she directed the pilot ep for The Killing which I thought was fantastic. I never saw Monster but I knew that WB would not trust such a delicate and important IP into someone they know that''s not up to task. And boy, did Patty delivered. Bringing to life such a multi-layered character requires passion and a keen eye for detail. Her love for WW,and also for film making, is so evident in this movie. This just proves that not only male directors can drive a tentpole movie of this scale. Diversity is still a big issue in Hollywood and it''s sad that Patty had never done a movie since Monster. She''s one of the most talented and smart directors out there. And I''m really glad that it was her who brought Wonder Woman to life. I really hope that Warner Bros lock her down. Give her any movie she wants to do, coz she earned it. I cannot praise her more for giving us a movie that will stand the test of time. This is a triumph not only for Wonder Woman but for film in general.

Gal''s Wonder Woman journey wasn''t at all smooth sailing. She had been often criticized for her lack of acting prowess. But Gal landing the coveted role was maybe a gift from the gods themselves. Prior to getting the part, she was supposed to play the female badass in Man of Steel, Faora Ul. But alas, she had to drop out due to her pregnancy. Zack and co. should be very proud of this casting choice. They''ve found the Wonder Woman for this generation. I cannot see anyone other than Gal playing WW, just like I can''t see another Tony Stark or Logan played by someone else. She fully embodies WW. She can be both a warrior and a person full of compassion in a sec, which is the true definition of Wonder Woman. She IS Wonder Woman.

As for the supporting characters, Chris Pine was great. His chemistry with Gal is one of the key elements of this movie. The Amazons were all breathtaking and strong. I hope we can see more of them in the future. Steve''s pals were fantastic especially Etta and Sameer. The villains was so-so but they''ve served their purpose, and the twist about Ares was not something you could''ve anticipated( unless you frequent reddit)

But the true magic that WW leaves after you watched it, is that sense of optimism. I have never experienced that in any superhero movies, or just movies in general. In this bleak and dark world that we live in, a little piece of hope wouldn''t hurt at all. You want to be like Wonder Woman. You aim to be better.

- Too long.
- It falls a little bit apart in the final big scene.

On the one side, I like it. It was good, and I did enjoy it. But on the other hand it wasn''t what I expected it to be - I had high expectations, I enjoyed the trailers and even though I block myself from reviews before watching and experiencing a movie myself, I did realize that people where loving it. So maybe I also had some really high expectations - I don''t know.

However, the movie did not wow me the way that Man of Steel or even Batman v Superman did. Maybe, those did because MoS I had no expectations at all (I am no Superman fan) and BvS I did not expect to be so much about Batman (I love Batman). Wonder Woman however I do not have any childhood connections to, and never followed her, and her role in BvS wasn''t the best - not because of she was bad, no - but because it was introduced in probably the most unfortunate way.

Taking all movies of the DC Universe into account, Wonder Woman is better than Suicide Squad for sure. However it is worse than both MoS and BvS - so somewhere between 7 and 8, and I actually put it on an 8 beforehand, but thinking a lot about it, I''d rather see it at 7.

The movie starts really great, I love the child Diana actor - and don''t get me wrong: I love what this is doing for small girls who love becoming her, who will dress up like her on Hallween, etc. It''s great! And that alone deservs a good rating. But, looking at the movie from a cinephile perspective, there is again a lot of things that I have to critizise.

What I loved: The fighting scenes, especially in the beginning. They are great - I would have loved it to be R-Rated, a bit more brutal, such as Fox''s Logan - it would have done the movie better. But okey. That''s just a small thing. Bigger however is the missing atmosphere. What I love about MoS and BvS is this dire atmosphere, the hopelessly, which is not only expressed by the story, but which is also aided by the camera work, by the beautifull imagery, by sometimes the shaky cams, etc. In Wonder Woman, which is set in the First World War, which is discussed as one of the most horrible wars we''ve ever experienced, when it comes to brutallity, mortallity, and the way the war was fought (trenches and gas attacks, etc.), we should ge a dire atmosphere as well. However, what we actually are presented with jokes, with silly characters, etc. All these things take some of the seriousness of the entire situation and that also affects the credibility of the entire situation. I cannot believe that Wonder Woman is so touched by the wouded people, for example - yes she wants to fight, she was born for this, she feels this to be her purpose - no question. But then she''s war/fighting hungry - and that is okey. But her feeling shocked when seeing the wounded? She feeling the need for helping those people freeing their village? I don''t feel that, when seeing it. They are saying it, but it''s not credibil, especially if it was said between two jokes.

That is not me saying I didn''t like any of the jokes - especially in the beginnig they where somewhat nice, and put her in an interesting spot, because on the one side she seems like the strong, unapproachable and unrelatable fearless godlike warrior; but giving her being thrown in a world she doesn''t know and doesn''t understand making her appear even naive in some situation, that on the other hand makes her relatable, makes her cute and funny in the same time. And I enjoyed these two contraries.

Another thing killing the amtosphere was the sometimes overdone action. [spoiler]I mean, seriouly: She jumpes into the window of a church tower and the whole building collapses? Why doesn''t she jump all the time and by doing so invoke some earthquakes killing all the enemies?[/spoiler] Not only does she sometimes show powers unmatchable and therefore breaking the mood: She also seems unbreakable. She never takes a scratch, she''s never tired, never wounded, never in doubt, nothing. She''s even hardly in pain about loosing some of her loved ones. And that makes all the action irrelevant, because you know that she will never be overpowerd in any situation. That''s what Marvel is doing and that''s what set the frist DC movies appart: We had Superman, who is fighting an inner conflict by protecting those who are fighting him, and we have Batman, who is broken because of his past - we have heroes that are wounded, that bleed, that can actually die and this makes it even more interesting to watch, more thrilling, more realistic and relevant.

And then - this is probably just me, but actually I hate it when Germans are played by English actors, and the only way you realize that they are Germans is because they speak in an accent. Why? We are in the Post-Inglorious Basterds era, where Tarantino had shown us, how great movies can become when you do them multilingual. The French speak French? The woman in the Trench spoke something (that I did not recognize)? We had Italian, we had Chinese. And we hat a lot of fun with different British Accents used in this movie. Hell, they even made all the other Amazones speak a Israeli accent, so that it doesn''t sound weird that Gal Gadot had one - that is intelligent script writing! But why then not have the Germans speak Geramn? Makes a movie so much more fun to watch. It is of course just a minor thing, but it adds to the list.

So up to now I listed everything wrong with this movie - however not everything is. I think the acting was great - I am not a fan of Gal Gadot, but I think in the role of Wonder Woman she has mad her best performance yet. She fits perfectly into this role and I cannot imagine any other actress that can fill this movie with both, the power of an fearless strong female lead, who at the same time keeps her feminine features, and who has the right amount of sexiness without it being too much, sexist, etc. And I also liked Chris Pine - he is just about right, without being too much, and also fits perfectly into his role. Also I enjoyed the fighting scenes - they really maxed out everything they could - being an R-Rated movie this still looks absolutely stunning and great and just makes a lot of fun.
I also found the story to be reasonable, it is really good, you can follow throuhg and find every step making absolutely sens (lessons learned from Suicide Squad wich in that department was aweful). And somehow it does rectify her role in BvS - I do believe that when rewatching BvS, I will like her character - I will not think "okey, where did she come from and who the hack is she and why is she there all of a sudden and helping them" - no. This scenes now will actually make total sense - I am sure of it, and I am looking forward to rewatching BvS.

As it goes for the DC Universe: I hope that Justice League will be a little bit more back to the DC roots, but I am looking forward to it - I love that DC is having a great success here and that finally they work and effort will pay off (after the not so well received BvS and the horrible critics on Suicide Squad, I was fearing a bit for them; I am especially keen on the single Batman movie. I want it to happen!). But I hope that they will also recognize that the main reason is that we have the first female comic hero lead that is captured on canvas. I loved their style thus far, with Suicide Squad one could see that they where adopting Marvels style and that did not pay out. This one has it''s flaws aswell and it does not mean to put back more comedy into the movies and take away their seriousness.

I love DC, I love Greek mythology, and Wonder Woman movies are generally the best of both worlds, at least that last animated one was amazing.  So my expectations were sky high after choosing to see this movie, over Alien, The Mummy and others currently at the box office.  I was definitely disappointed, but I really enjoyed the movie.  Just weird.

I wanted more from WW''s mother, first of all, since she was quite amazing in her own right from all the comics and previous movies.  I hated the love affair between WW and Captain Kirk, but I understand why it was so necessary for the plot.  And, mostly, she was basically Captain America in DC form.  Both in WWI, fighting the Germans, with a secret weapon, both on a special covert mission to end the war, both in USA colors wielding a shield to stop bullets and tank rounds, and more.  I disliked the cookie cutter similarities between the Cap and WW.  Lastly, I really disliked the flashbacks, within the flashbacks.  Just start the story from the beginning in the first place!

Now on to the Awesomeness that is the Wonder Woman movie.  Her abilities were top notch.  The superhero aspect was brilliantly captured and portrayed.  The animated version was ported into the real life version flawlessly.  She is by far the best superhero in film, next to, currently deceased, Superman.  Wolverine, Spidey, all the Avengers, Batman, Green Lantern, and anyone else with a movie franchise would easily get bitch slapped by WW.  Well, having said that, I do think Thor with Hammer, has a slight chance, but without Hammer, he is a peon compared to WW, [spoiler]the God Killer![/spoiler]  The fight scenes were simply amazing, the story was true to her past incarnations.  And the thing I liked most about this movie above all else was the ugliness of the movie.  It captured the underlying theme of femininity, excellently.  This was a dreary, dirty, ugly movie.  The sets were ugly, the costumes were ugly, the story/plot had a ugly feel to it.  The ugliness gave such a brilliant contrast to the breathtaking beauty of the star of the movie, Gal Gadot.  I couldn''t take my eyes off her.  Her beauty was unprecedented.  I know she isn''t the most beautiful woman in the world, but this movie made me believe Wonder Woman was.  Now the island of Amazons had some extremely attractive women on it, but Gadot was by far most beautiful of all.

It’s true, but limiting its quality to those terms does a disservice not only to how the film stands on its own, but how it represents a notable achievement (and hopefully turning point) for the representation of women in superhero cinema. But even on its own merits, Wonder Woman succeeds when it breaks away from the conventions of the cinematic universe cemented by its Bat- and Super-brethren, and stumbles when it gets caught in the same muck that has hobbled the movies of Wonder Woman’s D.C. stablemates. The end result is this cinematic universe’s first legitimately good film, but one still weighed down by the cinematic baggage of its predecessors.

It’s notable then, that *Wonder Woman*’s closest analogue on the silver screen would seem to be an amalgamation of the first *Thor* movie and *Captain America: The First Avenger*. It captures the latter’s sense of throwback adventure, inserting a superpowered individual into a world war and fighting the supernatural threats with a ragtag team of allies. And it captures the former’s sense of a god come to Earth, with the same sort of mantle-relinquishing, fish out of water comedy, and romance between deity and man that drove Kenneth Branagh’s lone foray into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

To that end, *Wonder Woman* most succeeds when it leans into those elements that have helped fuel the success of the MCU -- humor and human connections. The middle portion of the film is its best, in no small part due to the fact that it’s where the movie’s commitment to comic relief is strongest. It finds Diana Prince (Wonder Woman’s “world of man�? pseudonym) coming to WWI-era London and puzzling over the hypocrisies and odd conventions of this strange new land.

It’s here that star Gal Gadot does her best work in the film, playing the fish out of water with a combination of bemusement, confusion, and disbelief that makes Wonder Woman’s transition from a mythic queendom to scrubby London more than just one big scene change. Chris Pine (playing love interest and British spy Steve Trevor) shows off that fast-talking, aggrandizing-yet-self-deprecating charms that made him a nice fit as the heir to William Shatner in *Star Trek*. And the film has a ringer in Lucy Davis (of the original *The Office* fame) to show off her comic chops, along with assists from Trevor’s ragtag group of buddies. This commitment to humor livens the film and makes it easier to warm to its larger, globe-threatening plots.

But *Wonder Woman* also creates a convincing romance between Diana and Steve. The nature of the plot means it’s inevitably a bit rushed, and the closing portion of the film bogs down in trite ruminations on the power of love, but the heart of the film is founded on the relationship between those two people, and it absolutely works. That starts with Pine, who plays a convincing love interest with just enough guile and guts for a warrior to appreciate but just enough charm and wit to make a worth foil. But it ends with Gadot, who convincingly portrays the determined warrior warming to her guide to the world of man, and being pained by those harrowing moments when he is in danger. That fact alone makes them the two most compelling characters in the DCEU thus far, and the ones with best developed and most engaging inner lives.

That’s an important ingredient in the film, because *Wonder Woman* tends to falter when the two are not together in the story. The opening act of the film largely centers on Themyscira, Diana’s Greek myth-inspired homeland. It’s there that the film barrels through a fairly tedious origin story, mired in the usual clichés of “I want to fight!�?/�?No, you’re not ready�? done with the generic high fantasy stentorian pattern. Visually, the scenes are impressive, with colorful verdant growth all around, the fluid fighting style of the Amazons, and a brief art shift to deliver backstory. But beyond doing the paint-by-numbers work of establishing Diana’s will to war and deliver exposition and cryptic hints, the film ticks up once she makes it off the island.

But similar issues affect the film in the third act and in its action scenes. When sending Diana into combat, *Wonder Woman* defaults to the DCEU house style. That means antiseptic, undifferentiated action, filled with breakneck cuts and a lack of choreographic continuity. The film can’t escape the Snyder visual influences in these scenes, and while Snyder’s *300* is not a bad reference point for the mayhem of a Grecian warrior, the pre-viz backgrounds and the stop, start and slow tack of the fight scenes tend to dull rather than excite. That’s particularly true in the last portion of the film, when *Wonder Woman* meets its quota of CGI-drenched fisticuffs that leave every skirmish feeling like it was plucked out of a video game and deposited into a live action film.

That belies the theme of *Wonder Woman*, and Diana’s arc in the film -- that war is not a glorious or simple thing, but rather a complex source of grief, one not so giving of laurels nor easy to end or comprehend.

** *Caution: The remainder of this review contains major spoilers for Wonder Woman.* **

To that end, the cleverest part of the film is its third-act turn. After Diana kills General Ludendorff, the German commander she believes to be Ares, the god of war, in disguise, having cursed mankind with propensity for violence and conflict, she is shocked that the fighting nevertheless continues. It’s then than Ares emerges, in the form of Sir Patrick Morgan (David Thewlis, best known as Professor Lupin from the *Harry Potter* franchise), a member of England’s Imperial War Cabinet who spoke in favor of an armistice, revealing that it was only to prolong the broader conflict between nations.

It’s here that *Wonder Woman* reveals more complexity under the hood. Diana’s journey, from believing that war and by extension, evil, are a personified force that can be slain and thus defeated in black and white terms, to understanding that Ares had been pulling strings on both sides of this conflict and that the causes of such devastation are more complicated, is a sound one. Ares’s initial taunts and temptations prove the most convincing vehicle for this theme. And it provides an interesting arc for Diana, giving her a genuine coming of age story that helps grow the character.

The problem comes when the inevitable clash of titans arises and Ares words go from sounding like the honey-dripped promises and reassurances of the devil on your shoulder to the generic boasts and declarations of your bog standard movie villain. As soon as *Wonder Woman* embraces the complexity of its theme, it dumbs it down to the usual good and evil aphorisms.

That same issue extends to the film’s contemplation of, and its main character coming to terms with, the nature of humanity. At times, the film uses a light touch. There are hints in the brief stories of prejudice and oppression from Trevor’s friends Sameer (Saïd Taghmaoui) and Chief (Eugene Brave Rock) that the evil that lies in the hearts of men goes far beyond any god of war. And Ares’s own reveal shows the interesting notion that he merely stokes fires already burning in those on both sides of the war, rather than introducing something that wasn’t already there into a pure people.

But again, it devolves into standard bad guy clichés and typical voiceover claptrap about love being able to conquer hate. In that, *Wonder Woman* follows the leads of its DCEU predecessors like *Man of Steel* and *Dawn of Justice* which graze legitimately profound ideas but can never quite nail them down, and lose them entirely in the perfunctory climactic maelstrom.

Still, by any measure, *Wonder Woman* is a big step forward, both for D.C.’s efforts to establish a cinematic universe made up of worthwhile films, and for the cause of greater balance in the superhero genre on the silver screen. The movie is far from perfect, suffering from many of the same problems that dulled the impact of its fellow DCEU flicks. But in its humor, its heart, and who it chooses to tell a story about, it breaks away from those limiting issues and charts exciting new territory, both for this series of films and for comic book movies as a whole.', 'ACED00057372000D6A6176612E74696D652E536572955D84BA1B2248B20C00007870770A05000007E10604132DCD78', null, 0, -720288846, 0.5210496714105168, 0.000000004156803654342345, 'SUBJECTIVE', 0.9999999971151188, 'NEGATIVE', 0.5210496714105168, 0.4789503244326795, 'Trakt', 'https://trakt.tv/comments/129203', 1);

This was very entertaining with great action and good chemistry between the two lead actors.

La sua carriera è quasi da considerarsi unica e innovativa, soprattutto perchè, nell''anno in cui fece esordio sul n. 8 di All Star Comics, la maggior parte degli eroi vestivano i panni di maschi forti, pronti a fare sfoggio dei loro muscoli, pur di salvare le fanciulle in pericolo.
76 anni dopo la sua prima comparsa, Wonder Woman viene presentata sugli schermi delle sale cinematografiche con il volto di Gal Gadot, attrice e modella israeliana, conosciuta principalmente per il ruolo lei attribuito nella saga di "Fast and Furious". La trama ripercorre, grazie ad un flashback della protagonista, le origini del personaggio: principessa delle amazzoni, cresciuta su un''isola paradisiaca al riparo dal mondo esterno, fin da bambina la futura Wonder Woman è stata protetta dalle attenzioni di sua madre e del suo popolo. Il faticoso allenamento tradizionale per diventare una combattente invincibile le ha permesso di scoprire le sue doti nascoste, abilità innate fuori del comune persino su un''isola di grandi guerriere. Tuttavia, i poteri la investono di una responsabilità che sconfina dal suo piccolo regno e, con l''arrivo del pilota americano Steve Trevor, costretto a un atterraggio di emergenza sulle coste di Themyscira, Diana viene posta di fronte a una verità che non può ignorare: tra gli uomini imperversa infatti un atroce conflitto mondiale a cui lei vuole porre fine. Cresciuta con le storie della madre che le narrano di come Ares, il dio della Guerra, abbia corrotto gli uomini e di come fosse proprio responsabilità delle Amazzoni distruggere lui e tutto ciò che rappresenta, Diana è convinta di poter fermare la minaccia con le sue sole forze, così lascia la sua casa diretta verso il mondo degli uomini di cui ha sentito parlare soltanto nelle fiabe.
Realizzato in pellicola, nel tentativo di trovare un compromesso tra vintage e modernità, "Wonder Woman" si allontana nettamente dai precedenti "Batman v Superman" (2016) e "Suicide Suqad" (2016) guadagnandosi, per ora, il primo posto sul podio dei film che l''Universo Cinematografico DC ha prodotto. Tale merito, oltre alla regia, va in parte anche attribuito alla bravura di Gal Gadot che, indossatrice dal fisico slanciato, dall’eleganza naturale e capace di incarnare alla perfezione il ruolo che le viene attribuito, riesce a sorreggere sulle spalle una sceneggiatura non sempre lineare e priva di imperfezioni.
Dall''altro lato però Chris Pine, che qua riveste il ruolo di Steve Trevor, un ufficiale dell''intelligence dell''Esercito degli Stati Uniti, a volte risulta essere inespressivo, come occultato dall''ombra e dalla bravura che l''interpretazione della Gadot riesce a far emergere dal suo personaggio. Poco sviluppati anche i due nemici, il Generale Ludendorff, comandante dell''esercito tedesco e la sua assistente il Dr. Poison, una banale scienziata pazza priva di una degna caratterizzazione il cui scopo primario non va oltre il creare armi di distruzione di massa sempre più potenti ed efficaci.
Discorso diverso riguarda invece più da vicino le sequenze di combattimento che, sebbene siano sorrette da coreografie eccellenti e da una colonna sonora incalzante precedentemente già ascoltata in "Batman v Superman", eccedono in ralenti e slow motion che mettono in risalto più lo stampo commerciale di Zack Snyder, produttore del film, che lo sguardo autoriale della regista Patty Jenkins. Pesano anche gli effetti speciali utilizzati per la battaglia finale in cui si alterna un villain digitale dalle fattezze già viste e uno scontro costituito sulla forza fisica piuttosto che sulla scaltrezza della protagonista.
Nonostante questi elementi, nelle sue due ore e mezza di durata, il film non risulta mai noioso o monotono anzi, intrattiene ed incolla lo spettatore al grande schermo coinvolgendolo in una storia visivamente curata e narrativamente incalzante.', 'ACED00057372000D6A6176612E74696D652E536572955D84BA1B2248B20C00007870770A05000007E106030E12D478', null, 0, -1653122968, 0.6982788624116197, 0.10145646619656316, 'OBJECTIVE', 0.3159079752727209, 'NEGATIVE', 0.6982788624116197, 0.2002646713918171, 'Trakt', 'https://trakt.tv/comments/129036', 1);

Being straight up and honest but I had no anticipation for this film whatsoever. The trailers were cool and Gal Gadot looked perfect for the role from what I could tell, the problem was I never really cared for the character of Wonder Woman, admittedly I don''t really care for any superheroes unless your name is Batman. And with the DCEU track record being abysmal, Suicide Squad being one of the biggest disappointments since my birth, Batman V Superman just being utter shite and appreciating Man of Steel but if not really being my thing, it was easy for me to go into this film with the lowest expectations.
I can safely say this is the best ''superhero'' film I''ve seen since ''The Dark Knight Rises''. It''s not a perfect film and not even close to being on the level of the Dark Knight trilogy, it doesn''t need to be though because this is hopefully the first big step into making the DCEU into something...well, simply put, better.
First off, Gal Gadot, she owns the role of Wonder Woman and can honestly say nobody could''ve done a better job. She sold every aspect of the character to me, whether she''s killing Germans or having more of the heart felt moments with Chris Pine''s character, it all works incredibly well. You do have your basic 3 ark structure when it comes to these kinds of films, Origin, Action, 1V1. But it''s the moments in between all of this that makes the film special and better than the rest. I found some of the smaller moments between Diana and to feel natural and didn''t come off cheesy like it so easily could have, great chemistry together and really help flesh out her character even more when she''s thrown into his world and we see it through her eyes, in great comedic taste might I add.
The action scenes are also spectacular, some of the CG and green screen downs unfortunately stand out and become blatantly obvious at times, but I can almost forgive that just because of how well choreographed it all was.
My biggest flaw and sadly it seems to be like this whether it''s marvel or DC; villains (minus Heath Ledgers Joker don''t worry). Yet again we find another generic ''I want to kill people'' villain, just found the villain characters so bland and was there just to have a ''threat'' and a big fight at the end, got to have a big fight at the end of what''s the point right?
All in all, I found this to be a fun action film, but with some great heartfelt moments dotted through out, more than I thought there would be and that''s what made this film a little bit more special to the rest. Gal Gadot does an incredible job at playing Diana and if anything, at least we''ll have her in Justice League if all else fails in that film. Saying that however, I do hope all the trashy DC films are behind us and we can move onwards and upwards.

Brilliant introduction to the First Lady of comics, there are many superheroines but WW is the original and still the best. The portrayal by Gal Gadot is spot on, as is Chris Pine as Steve Trevor. I don''t want to say too much as I''ve decided to make this a spoiler free review but I will say that if you are kinda on the fence about this film cos maybe u didn''t like the other films the DCEU, never fear cos this is a completely different tone. Patty Jenkins has brought a certain brightness and freshness to this movie that sets it apart from the Zack Snyder films we''ve seen thus far (tho I personally like his offerings).

Being an old school comic collector and a fan of the Wonder Woman character, I gotta say that they''ve really nailed her origin for the big screen and the story explains well why we haven''t seen her in a long time up til the point we see her in Batman vs Superman.

There''s a great mix of action, comedy and emotion with a twist or two so something for everyone. Whether you''re a comic geek like me or just a casual movie viewer, I highly recommend going out to watch this film.

ALMOST.

Wonder Woman can be summarized as a great interrupted nerd coitus.
The starting was really enjoyable, everything was going smooth as butter. Movie was fun, was interesting, was hyping as fuck. Gal Gadot is phenomenal, Chris Pine made me gay (again), Elena Anaya converted me back to being hetero... but then... the inevitable happened.

Something I was expecting all along, something I expect every-single-time a movie about a DC character gets announced.

**SOMETHING - FUCKS - UP**
  (badly, very, very badly)

In other movies like... BVS or Suicide Squad, wait a minute... I admit it''s not entirely fair comparing it with those two, considering at least Wonder Woman was a bit enjoyable for the first 2.5/4 of it.

Anywho, in this case, what bothered me a lot - interrupted nerd coitus - was the ending.

The movie transformed from a breath of fresh air to the same overbuilt, overcheesed, oversped, overfucked, overterribilized™ piece of stinking shit that DC (Or whoever fucks their characters up) accustomed us to.

Why you ask? Well... it''s simple.

The major problem was in fact with the speed they clearly made the ending to be.

I can explain this with a simple equation:

[spoiler]Lover("I love you"+Suicide)+(Terrible cgi)=Angry Gal Gadot=God Wonder Woman=????????????????[/spoiler]

[spoiler]She kills Ares, but it wasn''t Ares (no shit) - then Ares appears (no shit) - then he''s way too powerful (no shit) - BANG! BIG SECRET REVEALED (no shit) - Gal Gadot is so confused she hit herself (no shit) - Big Jim does a Captain America and saves everyone (no shit) - Gal Gadot becomes god -- "INSERT HERE STUPID PHOTOGRAPHY, CGI, POINTLESS GLORIFYING WALKING SCENES" - Ares is dead (no shit).[/spoiler]

That said: I must say that I enojyed this movie more than... scratch that, this is the only DC character movie I enjoyed following the current DCCU (DC Cinematic Universe)[God Bless Christopher Nolan''s soul]. It truly had meaning and potential, but I guess they ran out of minutes.

Sad.

Gal Gadot is hot as fuck.

For perhaps the first time in my life, I am completely speechless. I just got back from an early screening of the movie (we have early screenings in Poland! Who knew?). I''m going to try and collect my thoughts as I write, but I''m just buzzing with excitement, so I make no promises as to how this will turn out. I hope you''ll stick with me regardless.

After BvS and Suicide Squad were poorly received by critics (and audiences too, although here the opinions were more divided), a lot of people were afraid of how this movie would turn out. And I swear, no one was more scared than me. I didn''t grow up with Wonder Woman - hell, I wasn''t even aware of her existence until like two years ago, but I so desperately wanted her movie to succeed. A female superhero in the title role and a female director? That is huge. That''s something I''ve been waiting for since I was a kid. And I spent the last year kind of holding my breath, hoping with all my might that this movie would be good.

And it is. Thank the gods, it really is.

Oh, and before I forget: this review will be spoiler-free, I don''t intend to ruin any of the important plot points for anyone.

So, let''s get to it, shall we?

First of all, the plot. The plot is simple, linear, without unnecessary storylines shoehorned in there for no reason. That doesn''t make it any less engaging or exciting, of course. If anything, it allows you to really immerse yourself in the story. And boy, is the story great. There''s plenty of cliches there, but honestly, there is something to be said about cliches. If done correctly, they are amazing. And they definitely are done correctly here.

The movie looks gorgeous as well. There are actual colors there, along with some stunning shots. The editing is on point, everything flows pretty much flawlessly.

The music is sick. I mean, they managed to incorporate WW''s theme in there, with all of its electric cello glory. And it''s just... insane.

The action scenes will make you want to fist pump and yell "Hell yeah!". Whatever you''re imagining, I promise you, the movie will exceed your expectations. I still have goosebumps and it''s been like an hour since I left the theatre.

As for the acting, everyone does a wonderful (no pun intended) job. I want to talk about Gal Gadot for a second, because I feel like a lot of people had doubts as to whether or not she could handle such a huge role and such an iconic heroine. Worry not. She''s got this. It''s actually kind of jaw-dropping how much she''s got this. She pours everything she has into this performance. Her Diana is layered, a perfect balance of innocently naive and fiercely badass. She brings heart and humanity and a range of emotions to the character. She will make you laugh. She will make you cry. And most importantly, she will make you feel the sheer power and confidence that she radiates while still having moments of vulnerability. She''s glorious. She IS Wonder Woman.

Everyone loves Chris Pine, and he does a great job here as well. Steve Trevor keeps up with Diana without once trying to overshadow her and they make a fantastic duo. And he has his fair share of cool moments as well. Connie Nielsen and Robin Wright manage to do a lot with the few scenes they''re given. Lucy Davis is super funny. Overall, a pretty awesome cast of supporting actors.

And finally, what struck me the most about this movie was how heartfelt and genuine, and just... good it was. I mean, it''s a brilliant movie, but it''s also good in the sense that it inspires you and fills you with hope and optimism, which I think is something we rarely get in movies nowadays. It warms your heart and makes you feel so many different things. It hits all the right notes. There''s no shortage of dramatic, incredibly emotional moments that will bring tears to your eyes. But it''s also often hilarious and joyful - I laughed out loud more than once, and so did the rest of the room.. And when it wants to be epic, it is larger than life, powerful and spectacular.

I recognize and respect the fact that to many people, this movie won''t be perfect. But to me, it is. It''s everything I wanted it to be and then some. Hats off to Patty Jenkins, Gal Gadot and everyone else involved. They created something truly incredile. I''m seeing it again on Saturday. And quite possibly a few more times after that. If I blow all my money on tickets for this movie, it will be worth it. No regrets.

Now, time to go to bed and cry about how much I love Diana. I hope everyone has as unforgettable an experience with Wonder Woman as I did.

UPDATE: Having seen this movie 4 times in 2 weeks, I can safely say that it''s insanely rewatchable. Also, I''m an emotional mess who''s cried at least 3 times during each one of those 4 screenings. I''m fairly certain that this movie actually gets better the more you watch it.', 'ACED00057372000D6A6176612E74696D652E536572955D84BA1B2248B20C00007870770A05000007E1051F1507F378', null, 0, 1793588264, 0.030759651526028442, 0.0000000000005127615631986945, 'SUBJECTIVE', 0.9999999998280805, 'POSITIVE', 0.9692403484734589, 0.9692403484734589, 'Trakt', 'https://trakt.tv/comments/128736', 1);

Also, yeah, it''s basically a flat and linear love story.

The movie comes off as a "different kind of superhero movie", when actually, when it come down it - it''s just the same: guy, *.some_accident, superpower, mask, girl, save girl as girlfriend, kill villain. The only difference is that it''s rated R now, which is better then suck-up movies such Iron Man, Cpt. America, etc.

If it was really different, this boring scheme of a plot should have changed entirely. The "Just add F*cks !" startup doesn''t cut it for me.

As I reached my 30''s, I''ve now out grown superhero movies. I though this might be different, but it came up short.

If you''re bored of the superhero genre - don''t bother watching it. Doesn''t live up to the hype.
Plain 6/10.

I don''t like Superhero movies, i think the "The Avengers" films are fucking terrible. Others are either boring like Ant-Man or solid like Guardians of the Galaxy.

Deadpool (aka Wade Wilson) is a hero/villain out for revenge/fun in the most entertaining way possible.  Think the Punisher crossed with a clown (maybe even the clown from Stephen Kings It).

As far as making a film about Deadpool goes, I walked in with very little confidence, but a bucket load of hope.  The comics are fun, but the amount of convention breaking that happens, and the general tone of the pieces, should have made for a LOT of problems in capturing an audience, and trying to have some manner of plot.  But what we got was a pleasant surprise.  As expected fourth walls were broken (this appeared to be the marketing slogan at times for the film in interviews), f-bombs were dropped, and there was enough blood and splats to question whether the 15 rating in the UK should have been an 18.  I think the only way it got the 18 was because the gore was so comically daft, that no-one could be truly grossed out by it.  But then, if you look at the BBFC notes, it says "strong bloody violence, strong language, sex references".  I think the word very is used extremely loosely here, also ''sex references'' should probably just say drop the word ''references'' altogether.

The way the film pans out as a piece is, at times, a little more generic than some Deadpool fans would have wanted (damsel in distress, bad-times-mutation, flashbacks), but it still did it''s best at trying to break these conventions anyway.  What with the bad-times-mutation being some rather nasty torture, or that the damsel-in-distress is pretty bad-ass themselves, I think we can forgive it''s sins here.  After all, without these conventions, we may have ended up with the sketch-show style I went in concerned about.  Also, as many other reviews have noted, there were budgetary constrains on this film which threatened a family friendly rating.  But these constraints aided in getting the sub 2-hour film we get, and some of the jokes are directed at this too, pulling no punches.

But as a review, the film was great fun to watch, and at less than 2 hours (which is always a blessing with an action-comedy),  I would certainly recommend going to watch it to others, so long as all the notes I made above haven''t put you off.  The only downside left for me is that I now have to discuss this film with my mum tonight, with no idea how that will go, or what questions will be asked of me.

Now we just have to await the sequel, and so long as the budget isn''t high, Reynolds is back, and we have a certain silver-haired cyborg from the future, I will be happy.

Deadpool is at its best when it''s making fun of superhero movies. The film feels like a counter-reaction to the prominence and seriousness of comic book films in pop culture, and in that vein, it''s a success. When it fills the opening credits with a description of its actors rather than their actual names (e.g. "Moody Teen", "British Villain"), features knowing winks to its star''s emerald-tinged prior efforts as a cape, and plays "Angel of the Morning" behind its freeze-framed mayhem, it''s a statement of purpose, an indication from the very beginning that this is not going to be your standard superhero flick, and the movie is very much in on the joke.

And yet the movie is at its weakest when it gives into that seriousness, when it hits the usual beats of a standard good guy origin story, including a bland baddie and lost love. The film does its best to throw in a comedic riff on these moments, with playful quips directed at the film''s villain, even as he cycles through the requisite bad guy threats and intimidation routine, and ribald remarks permeating the tragic backstory and romance. It''s a firm attempt to try to take some of the edge off of bland baddie Ajax (Ed Skrein) and his wooden, generic henchman Angel Dust (Gina Carano), who are the most standard-issue characters in the film. But at its core, Deadpool can''t completely run away from the typical superhero movie rhythms it employs, even as it''s trying to make fun of them, and that drags it down in the moments where the film tries to be a little more conventional or serious.

Thankfully, the lead character provides plenty of comedic juice, both in the suit and outside of it. Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) is effectively a murderous Bugs Bunny, causing mayhem that looks like some cross between Kill Bill and Tex Avery. Reynolds nails the characters charming irreverence, and the script belies any attempts to show a true heart of gold beneath the barrage of bullets and sarcastic asides.

If anything, Deadpool goes too far in the other direction, having its lead repeatedly affirm that he is not, in fact, a hero -- that he is, instead, just a bad guy who goes after people who are worse. That''s a great premise for a character, and the fact that the film doesn''t shy away from its R-rating or from showing Deadpool plying his trade with little care or concern for Truth, Justice, and The American Way. But having him vocalize that point repeatedly makes Deadpool himself feel more like the rebellious teenager who makes a point to constantly remind you that he doesn''t care.

Despite that, in the moments where Deadpool avoids the pitfalls of backstory fatigue and rescue mission malaise, it is a delightfully breezy, eminently enjoyable film. Director Tim Miller perfectly captures the screwball, irreverent tone necessary for the piece to work, from his main character''s looney mayhem, to the comedic exchanges between Deadpool and his wife Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), buddy (T.J. Miller), and roommate (Leslie Uggams), all of which have their own distinct flavor and weird, off-color charms.

Make no mistake, Deadpool is a film that wears its raunchiness on its sleeve. Reynolds'' history as Van Wilder served him well for the movie''s puerile sensibilities, culminating in a parade of horribles game of oneupsmanship that serves as both his and Vanessa''s meetcute and their reconciliation. The movie is not above making jokes about sex, masturbation, and genitalia in general. To that end, the script has the feel of the standard X-Men outing grafted into a Robot Chicken sketch. I''m certainly not too classy to enjoy the film''s thoroughly juvenile charms, and the unabashed way it embraces its sophomoric, self-mocking tone keeps things light and fun.

The film also preserves Deadpool''s fourth wall-breaking asides. It''s a delicate balance, and staying on the right side of the Ferris Bueler line is no small feet. But when Deadpool talks to the audience about who he had to pleasure to get his own movie, or cautions that his suit shouldn''t be green or animated, or complains about his confusion as to which actor is playing Professor X at this point in the timeline, it''s another sign that the film is having fun with the excesses of the genre and his X-men Universe stablemates. Too much of that post-modern take on comedy can be grating, but Miller parcels out just enough to make it a treat instead of a gimmick.

In many ways, Deadpool feels like the raunchier cousin of Guardians of the Galaxy. Both films feature a less-than-savory protagonist; both trade in classic tunes played over silly action scenes; and both attempt to undercut any necessary serious moments with a joke and subvert the big comic book ending just enough to add-in an enjoyable twist that tells the audience what kind of a franchise this is and what kind of a "hero" they''re dealing with. Guardians is a bit more earnest in the effort, and certainly tamer by comparison, but both films prove that you can make a superhero movie that is as much of a comedy as it is an action-adventure tale, regardless of where the humor is pitched.

Deadpool does revel in its sense of subversion. The main character pushes back at Colossus''s moralizing about becoming a hero (and ribs his teenage sidekick for her sullen silences and sharp remarks in one of the film''s funniest bits). And just when it seems like he''s about to give in and spare his enemy, Deadpool shoots the guy point blank, right in the middle of the metal man''s speech. That type of attitude, that eschews the usual tropes of crime-fighting stories and throws in a ribald quip for good measure, makes Deadpool a refreshing, often hilarious enterprise that knows what it wants to be and doesn''t hold back. If only it could sustain that energy and aim throughout the film, rather than devolving, at times, into damsels in distress and a typical revenge tale with a checkered past tacked on for good measure, it would succeed unequivocally. Instead, Deadpool is a tremendously funny film with a delightful comedic verve that sustains it from beginning to end, even if, occasionally, it can''t quite escape the baggage of its super suit-wearing brethren.

Misteri Batu Abadi di Film Marvel Terjawab dalam Thor: Ragnarok?
4 Artis Ini Bertahan Hidup dengan Berjualan


Diberitakan oleh Collider, Jumat (6/1/2017), ini hanyalah salah satu dari malapetaka yang dihadapi Thor di film ini. Pahlawan Asgard ini bahkan terpisah dari Mjolnir miliknya.
"Thor dipenjara di dunia lain tanpa palu dahsyatnya. Ia harus berkejaran dengan waktu untuk kembali ke Asgard dan menghentikan Ragnarok."
Bagi yang kurang familiar, Ragnarok adalah bagian dari mitologi Skandinavia yang menggambarkan kehancuran Asgard. Dalam sinopsis ini, terkuak bahwa Ragnarok dipicu oleh kehadiran karakter baru, Hela, yang dimainkan oleh aktris dengan jam terbang tinggi, Cate Blanchett.








Konsep film Thor: Ragnarok
"Namun sebelum itu ia harus menghadapi kontes gladiator yang mengadunya dengan rekannya di Avenger—The Incredible Hulk!"
Apakah ini berarti Hulk akan menjadi karakter antagonis di film ini? Belum jelas bagaimana Hulk dan Thor akhirnya harus bertarung hingga mati dalam film garapan sutradara Taika Waititi ini. Namun yang jelas, kisah plot tentang ini terlihat mengikuti alur di komik Hulk yang menyebutkan superhero ini akan terlibat dalam pertandingan gladiator di dunia lain.








Chris Hemsworth bersama sutradara Taika Waititi
Selain kehadiran Cate Blanchett, informasi lain yang diketahui tentang Thor: Ragnarok adalah kembalinya Tom Hiddleston, Anthony Hopkis, dan Idris Elba. Dalam film ini hadir pula Jeff Goldblum sebagai Grandmaster, Tessa Thompson sebagai Valkyrie, dan Karl Urban sebagai tokoh antagonis Skurge. Benedict Cumberbatch juga disebutkan bakal muncul sebagai Doctor Strange.

I don’t know if it’s because I prefer more serious takes on superheroes but before you leave the hater reply hear me out.

I feel like you have to have a mix to cater to audiences both like me and the people that like the joking around. Other MCU movies at this point had a fairly ok mix for my taste but when you go 250% like on this film (or like Guardians of the Galaxy) you end up with things like scenes that are supposed to have emotional weight [spoiler] like the ending scene on the escape vessel or even The Hulk''s identity crisis[/spoiler] come off as cherry and funny which they may not need to be. I feel like films like Wonder Woman (as a DC example, it’s flaws aside) and The Winter Soldier (as an MCU example, also it’s flaws aside) to be a good mix of both seriousness and “jokiness�? and the ratings reflect it.

Understand that I don’t think it’s a bad movie, It’s very well produced, has a great cast and it''s very well directed as we’ve come to expect from Marvel’s high budget.

However, the trailer looked interesting, I love the 80s style with the colours, it promised to be a wild movie with a great antagonist - I mean seriously - what could go wrong with Cate Blanchett, and even better in a dark gothic look?

Well, I was absolutely disappointed. Seriously, what where they thinking when shooting/editing this movie? There is no plot, the story is totally random and has no meaning at all anymore. It''s just like a bad 90s sitcom that is progressing from one joke to the next, and this time it didn''t stop at anything - stupidity, slapstick, vulgarity, we have it all, and without any style or niveau. I mean seriously "Oh, I''m drunk, I will just fall down" (as an entrance of a new and important character), "oh, I just saw hulks penis", "now we''ll have to fly into the anus", etc. What''s the target audience of this movie, childish boys in their puberty? I think even for them this is rather embarrassing than funny....

Epic, dramatic fighting scenes, e.g. when Hela defeats Asgard are equaly destroyed by stupid jokes as are emotinal scenes. Someone died? Just make a joke. Haha, and let''s go on. Due to this, this movie wasn''t exciting to me at all, it wasn''t emotional, it was just dull. This movie is so jokes-packed, that even after the first three minutes (and did they really just do the stupid rope-joke in the introduction three times?! It was hardly funny the first time, it was annoying the second time, and the third I was angered, because obviously the director must think I am stupid), I had enough. And that is somewhat sad, because in the mass of stupid jokes there are some moments that actually where pretty great and that would have functioned superb in isolation. Take Jeff Goldblums character that is refreshingly eccentric and funny. Or Korg - great humoristic character. But having a more than 2 hour sitcom, this doesn''t work anymore, even if it''s good.

I do believe the story had potential, I mean they had a great soundtrack, stunning visuals, perfect CGI, absolutely gorgeous colours and scenes, a really great cast, I already mentioned the great Jeff Goldblum, who I found ingenious. Cate Blanchett is always a win, and she could have brought so much to this movie. And Tessa Thompson also stuck out to me - great charisma, interesting character. But none of them gets enough chance to really portrait their character, none of them gets any dept. Especially Cate Blanchetts talent is totally wasted - she could have been absolutly evil, strong, powerful - the perfect villain. But she isn''t - the antagonist is (as with so many comic movies these days) a joke and a total disaster. There is hardly any substance, much to short screen time for character develpment, for backgrounds, for some seriousness. Nothing.

Seriously, I wouldn''t have been surprised if there was laughter from the off.....

The only time I said that was for Guardians of the Galaxy, but this movie was truly the best

I won''t say that this movie was better than I expected cuz to be honest they marketed it very well and my expectations were very high and it successfully reached what I was hoping for


The amount of comedy in this film was amazing, this movie was really really funny LOL, especially with the Hulk scenes I couldn''t help myself

I liked what they did with the Hulk he was scary yet very very cute, I know it''s strange to call The Incredible Hulk as cute but he truly was, they made him like a child and he talks to himself in the third person LOL, even others

&gt;Hulk stay, Thor go

Of course everything else also was amazing the visuals, the story, the FXs and the fight scenes

Hella was one of the best female characters I''ve ever seen, she was hot and BADASS, she was simply amazing


The last thing that shocked me was that they went with the story of Thor loosing one of his eyes like his father, I gotta say I wasn''t expecting that at all and I don''t know if they showed pics of this moment before but I haven''t heard anything so it was the first time I''ve seen this in the theater

     Worse than the music though, is the lackluster script.  If you took Scooby and Shaggy in a room they most likely could have created a better dialogue than what is seen in Thor.  The actors themselves even seem to have trouble delivering the lines and a sense of boredom is felt through the screen.  there are many reasons for this, one of the main being that most films today are filmed almost exclusively in chroma key rooms.  It can be very challenging at times, even for the best actors, to adapt to this style and successfully bring a fully realistic sense of feeling to the screen.
     All in all, while the graphics are somewhat decent (aside from a few glitchy distance shots and such that can be found in any film regardless of age) the film is a gross failure of the Marvel Universe.

The special effects were innovative, and the myth arc was substantial, but it all might have fallen apart if you hadn’t felt the warmth, jostling, and connection between Luke, Leia, and Han. *Thor: Ragnorak*, while not nearly as good as *A New Hope* can rely on the same saving grace.

It too, can boast some pretty impressive special effects. With scant few minutes of screen time spent on Earth, a first for a Thor movie, director and franchise newcomer Taika Waititi goes wild with imagination in Asgard, new locale Sakaar, and other spots throughout the (conspicuously unguarded) galaxy. The design work in the film is impeccable, with candy-colored garbage dumps; lurid, pro-wrestling style showdowns, and fresco-like flashbacks. There’s the expect quotient of CGI combat and magical mayhem, commendable if common, but *Ragnarok* delivers on the promise of the weirdness and variety of Marvel’s cosmic realm.

The film also delivers its own myth arc. This one centers on a prophesied apocalypse, the oft named-dropped Ragnarok, that will supposedly leave Asgard in ruins. Thor aims to prevent this from happening, whether it means stealing the crown of a fire demon, defending against the ambitious, lebensraum-seeking Hela, or foiling the plans of his own treacherous brother Loki. The main plot of the film sees Hela, *Ragnarok*’s major villain, trying to take over Thor’s homeland, with eyes on doing the same to the whole universe, while Thor, stranded on the forgotten planet Sakaar tries to marshal resource and allies to return home and take her down.

But as decent a framework as that provides for a superhero flick, it almost feels perfunctory to the film. So do the character arcs, the good guy/bad guy fights, and the inevitable continuity nods and cameos. Instead, what makes the film work is giving Waititi a bunch of new toys and letting him welcome the audience into his sandbox for a while. *Ragnarok* doesn’t break much new ground for the genre, or make anything more than cosmetic changes to its major characters are when the credits roll, but it’s entertaining as hell from moment to moment, and that earns it plenty of goodwill.

That’s not a shock after Waititi’s last directorial effort, the hilarious *What We Do in the Shadows*. The film, a vampire mockumentary, has an overarching story that gives it some direction, and continuing developments that matter, but it’s more a collection of amusing scenes and episodes than a tightly-written, propulsive story. *Ragnarok* has a similar persistent but not unwelcome shagginess to it. The main plot takes forever to kick into gear, the various scenes sprinkled in from different corners of the galaxy either deliver exposition or focus more on our just heroes hanging around together, and by the time the inevitable third act uberclash arrives, it feels like more of a necessary capper than a culmination of what came before.

And yet, it’s an enjoyable, if occasionally lumpy two hours of superhero fun, and much of that comes from the simple joys of watching these characters bounce off one another. Chris Hemsworth has found his light as Thor, bringing the comic rounding to the high fantasy hero. Tom Hiddleston is one of the few breakout villains from the Marvel stable, and acquits himself with the usual aplomb. The trailers give away that Hulk is along for this ride, and between the green monster’s angry toddler-esque demeanor, and Mark Ruffalo returning the franchise’s fish out of water favor, he’s a fun addition to this part of the world. And Tessa Thompson joins the fray as Valkyrie, whose standard tragic backstory isn’t nearly as compelling as her presence as a hard-drinking, no B.S. “scrapper�? who fits nicely into Waititi’s milieu.

And that’s before you even get to the antagonists. Neither Hela, the film’s big bad, nor Grandmaster, the intermediate annoyance, have all that much to do in the movie. The former issues the usual assortment of threats and boasts, and the latter is given the usual corrupt leader schtick.

But that’s the beauty of enlisting ringers like Cate Blanchett and Jeff Goldblum to breathe life into these underwritten roles. Blanchett vamps it up with abandon as Hela. Between the killer design work and Blanchett’s presence, Hela feels far more textured and compelling than she might seem on the page, as the outstanding actress goes big but wins big. By the same token, Goldblum is at his Goldblum-y peak, with the stuttery, self-possessed charm that makes Grandmaster a boon to the film’s comic intentions and more than just an easily-overcome obstacle.

Add in ringers like Karl Urban as Hela’s lieutenant and finding a distinctive personality for a generic brute, and Idris Elba, who returns as Heimdall and is capable of making even the most shopworn blockbuster banalities sound profound, and you get a movie that’s just fun to watch at a scene-to-scene basis, even when it’s not clear that it’s really going anywhere.

That’s not to say that *Ragnarok* has nothing on its mind. While the metaphor never gets beyond skin deep, there’s an interesting parallel in England and other colonial empires at the center of the film. Hela is a partisan of a bygone era, where Odin conquered neighboring realms to build his kingdom. Thor is the inheritor of that kingdom, uneasy with that role and its legacy. The conflict between the two, and the confrontations and recriminations issued against Odin, nod toward the same reckonings happening in the modern world as industrialized nations try to reconcile their humanitarian presents with their dark, colonial pasts. Notions of erasing uncomfortable histories, finding pride in peoples rather than places, loom large in *Ragnarok*, and the subtext is apparent.

But apart from that idea, the third Thor movie is pretty lax about what it’s saying about its characters. Thor learns a lesson akin to “the real power was in your heart all along.�? Loki jumps back and forth along the heel/face line of demarcation as many times as you’d expect. And Hulk, Banner, and Valkyrie all find ways to confront their pasts in ways that, shockingly, dovetail nicely with the quest to defeat Hela.

Those arcs, however, aren’t really the point. The point is Thor assuring Hulk that he doesn’t like Banner, and then assuring Banner that he doesn’t like Hulk. The point is Grandmaster making fun of a depowered “Lord of Thunder�? for his “sparkles.�? The point is Valkyrie casually electrifying her prey until it’s compliant while sipping some intergalactic brew. The point is random items thrown at Loki, wry asides from Hela, and funny, soft-spoken rock monsters.

Waititi &amp; Co. aren’t out to revolutionize the superhero film. They’re not varying the formula all that much or taking the characters in markedly new directions or crafting some elegantly-constructed tale. They’re giving you two hours of creative, endearing, and eminently laugh-worthy entertainment, as enjoyable in chunks and stretches as it as a whole. *Ragnarok* may be no more than the sum of its parts, but those parts are too enjoyable to care.', 'ACED00057372000D6A6176612E74696D652E536572955D84BA1B2248B20C00007870770A05000007E10B041616CD78', null, 0, 1944807797, 0.07893339119899759, 0.000000013212590211808929, 'SUBJECTIVE', 0.9999999992503786, 'POSITIVE', 0.9210665955884123, 0.9210665955884123, 'Trakt', 'https://trakt.tv/comments/148168', 1);

How much is enough?

Thor Ragnarok is a comedy action movie, or simply put -&gt;


https://i.imgur.com/OqUYCJX.png


| FIRST THOUGHT |


Take Thor, mix it with Hulk.
Put your hand on the "comedy" button, press it and never release it.

It''s this movie.

And it doesn''t actually stop, throughout the entire time. You can''t quite figure out how much it takes itself seriously. And it''s so goddamn good.

Before you go on about and watch it, you need to put yourself in a spectrum where you''re going to enjoy senseless beating and constant, crispy comedy.

It is definitely worth watching. It is worth your time, your money and putting on clothes to get out of your home. (Or just do it like me, I never put on clothes.)


| STORY &amp; ACTORS |


Well, what can be said about the story on a Marvel movie?
However you want to put it, it''s actually nothing so special, there''s obviously no level of "deepness" to it. It''s very linear, of course, with a happy ending - Although I have to admit, very enjoyable.

It''s structured for the sole purpose of starting what is going to be the actual, gigantic movie: Infinity War - while closing down the history and settling the character of Thor for good. (Much better than what they did with Iron Man)

I think Marvel, with this one, truly captured the perfect combination of "comedy" and "action" to it''s MCU. Sorting out everything that lacked in the second installment of "Guardians of Galaxy".
The comedy was throughout really enjoyable, it was predictable, but we can''t pretend much of it - it''s classical "Thor &amp; Hulk" memes.

The story also doesn''t hold to a very interesting villain. It''s really unfortunate because of Hela''s position in the comics, but at the same time I can understand what the movie wanted to speak about, so I really cannot be as frustrated as I did with other movies. *cough*Wonder Woman*cough*

It does, at the same time, bring up new, fun characters (To the MCU). Korg (voice acted by also director Taika Waititi) was an absolute blast and pure enjoyment at everything he said. It can come out as pathetic or annoying, but that just means that you shouldn''t watch superhero movies.

I can''t talk enough about comedy without entering the realm of "acting", and in doing so, eventually to the actors.

/I will only "in-depth note" some of the actors\

I''ll say this, and it took me SIX movies to finally agree and accept it: Chris Hemsworth brought Thor to a level as high as Robert Downey Jr. and Hugh Jackman did with both Iron-Man and Wolverine. I can''t "unsee" a Thor that isn''t Chris Hemsworth, and this movie put on that thought the final stone.

He showed passion to a character that ended up developing itself positively in barely 2 hours and 10 minutes.

Mark Ruffalo, boy, they finally made him lose that terrifying, horrible gloomy attitude of the Avengers movie. He finally embraced his nature, and so Mark had more room to depict a promising version of Bruce Banner.

Cate Blanchett was disintegrated by the flatness of how they shaped Hela. The villain was disregarded and had no soul. It was just big talk, terrible powers, besides being a Charlie''s Angel and ultimately she didn''t show anything positive for the movie, except some stuff you will need to see.

Tessa Thompson was a FANTASTIC Brunnhilde. She portrayed that character to a point where the seconds passed and I loved her more and more. I can really say nothing more or add to it, just watch her.

I won''t talk about how the Hulk acted because you need to see it first-hand. He''s the big star here, remember, this is Hulkhor: Ragnasmask.

Jeff Goldblum as The Grandmaster is fucking weird, man... Weirdly good?


| CINEMATOGRAPHY |


Here''s where it gets interesting.
There''s a load of color combinations that I found soothing, very soothing and that is perfect because it brings out from the screen the variety and SATURATION of what this movie actually is. The palettes were perfect.

I found the CGI, in some of the action/fighting scenes to be lacking a little bit, especially in very fast-paced shots it looked very unrealistic. And the same can be said about everything, to the brittle of walls getting destroyed, to some of the weapons portrayed.
I don''t actually know what happened there, maybe I was too focused on it and eventually could see past the CGI (which is a big mistake to make), but unless you are actively trying to do so it''s really minor.

Choreographies, I was actually impressed. The past "Thor" movies were just a bunch of "tank &amp; spank" moves. Fortunately, this wasn''t entirely the case, near the end, it lacked a bit, but it''s not very noticeable considering everything that''s going on.

Music, there was distinct moment where it went from a more classical route to then being mixed out with a more electronic feel, it was a really hearing stimulating oxymoron, so to speak.
I will never get tired of The Immigrant Song by Led Zeppelin.


| FINAL THOUGHT |


All things considered, if we''re about to take this logically...

The pros definitely beat the cons in this one.
It is, on that thought, WORTH A WATCH.

And I''ll add something that might stir up some grunt:

My official "favorite MCU movie" has changed.

1. Doctor Strange
2. Thor: Ragnarok
3. Guardians of the Galaxy

Movie: 8/10
Hulk: 11/10

- Characterization of The Hulk.
- The fight scene between Hulk and Thor.
- It’s unpredictable, and things have stakes.
- The visuals.
- There is a very interesting story underneath it all.

Okay:
- Blanchett as Hela. She just doesn’t get enough to do, and cannot compare to Keaton in Homecoming. The campy angle worked though.
- Characterization of Valkyrie, I wanted to know more about her, but she worked fine as is.
- Most of the action.

Cons:
- Inconsistently paced (the beginning is very rushed, then Sakaar moves very slow, and the end is somewhere inbetween those two).
- Tonally inconsistent (the stuff on Asgard feels like a different movie than the stuff on Sakaar; it’s like LoTR and GotG)
- I found Ruffalo’s acting very shotty.
- Most of the humour fell flat for me (especially Goldblum, man, he just did not work for me here)
- One extended cameo felt very shoehorned in, and needed more exposition, as it made no sense as is.

I have two things to say: this is hands down the best installment in the Thor trilogy and it also definitely ranks somewhere in the top 5 MCU movies for me.

This movie was a wild ride from start to finish. The story was interesting and so many things happened along the way, keeping you engaged at all times. While I do love slow movies that allow their scenes to breathe, the crazy pace of this one worked in its favor. There wasn''t as much action as I had expected, but we did get some cool fights and general destruction. In the typical Marvel fashion, there were a lot of jokes and most of them were really, really hilarious. Some of the MCU movies try way too hard to be funny and I end up feeling annoyed at how many quips they cram in there, but in Ragnarok, the humor definitely worked. My personal favorites were the "Get help" scene, Thor''s story about Loki turning into a snake and Bruce falling onto the Rainbow Bridge (especially Fenrir''s reaction, like he was thinking "The fuck is this piece of meat doing?"). Those had me laughing uncontrollably. And on the other end of the spectrum, there was quite a lot of emotional weight to both Odin''s demise and the fall of Asgard. The movie struck a good balance between the two, keeping things exciting and light-hearted most of the time, but not being afraid to go a little deeper when the situation called for it.

As for the acting, Chris Hemsworth seemed to be really enjoying himself and while I''d often found Thor to be the blandest Avenger in the past, he had a lot more personality and charisma to him here. He was extremely likable and funny, but he was also the hero you rooted for throughout the movie. Cate Blanchett didn''t get to do much as Hela, to my disappointment. She looked incredible and she did the best she could with what she was given, but in the end, the Goddess of Death didn''t do much in terms of breaking the tradition of one-dimensional, evil-for-the-sake-of-it MCU villains. But she did at least seem to relish and enjoy her evilness. Tessa Thompson stole the movie for me. She was amazing as Valkyrie. She had wonderful chemistry with Thor and I like the idea of the two of them together, she''s a much better love interest for him than Jane, but she was by no means reduced to that role here (thankfully!). She was a fully-fledged character with her own arc and personality. She was brash, badass and absolutely deadly in a fight while still having a more vulnerable, softer side and dealing with horrible trauma. She reminded me of Jessica Jones in that way. Watching her go from a drunken scavenger back to a mighty warrior ready to fight for her home and her king was a pleasure. I absolutely loved her and I hope to see more of her in the future MCU movies. Tom Hiddleston delivered as always, Mark Ruffalo was a great addition and Bruce''s partnership with Thor was fantastic, and the supporting cast was also very good.

The soundtrack. Man, the soundtrack. 11/10, totally buying it. One of the best I''ve heard in a while.

The cinematography was gorgeous. So many colors, so many beautiful shots (the one with the Valkyries bathed in light riding towards Hela who was surrounded by darker colors? Holy shit, that looked like some kind of fancy-ass, baroque-ass painting. Absolutely stunning). It was a pleasure to watch. The special effects were simply outstanding as well. Fenris/Fenrir was magnificent and let''s just say I want ten angry, giant wolves immediately.

I had high hopes for this movie. The first Thor was pretty good, the second was meh (perfectly adequate, but painfully forgettable), but there was a lot of hype around this one and I really wanted it to be great. And it was! I had a blast watching it and I''d definitely see it again. Every standalone hero trilogy in the MCU so far has had at least one fantastic installment. Iron Man had the first one. Captain America had The Winter Soldier. Now, Ragnarok joins the circle.

I just finished a small production movie called Thor: Ragnarok….maybe you have heard of it or maybe if you’re lucky you might’ve even seen a trailer for this movie.

Ok totally kidding of course you know about this movie!! And you will hear a lot about it too in the coming days. Europe was lucky but alas America has to wait until the 3rd of November. So I will keep this spoiler free.

Not a real spoiler is that this is the 3rd movie of the Thor movies, and to my opinion it is the best of the 3!! Do you have to see the other 2 movies? No you don’t but it’s always better to do so. This movie starts not long after the Avengers: Age of Ultron, so it might be smart to rewatch that one again to know where some of the characters are. But it’s not a complete must, but I kinda think Marvel geeks already know all the movies by heart

Also not a spoiler is that this movie is also about the Grandmaster, who is played by Jeff Goldblum. The Grandmaster is the leader of the Contest of Champions, which is also a game app for Iphone and Android. It’s a little more funny if you play this game like I do (find MogwayLavendel in the game  )

This movie is action packed with great scenery, music, humor and some nods to other movies.
Unfortunately I saw it in 2D, but I am definitely going to see this one in the Dolby Atmos Ultra Laser 3D, yes this movie is so good that i’m going to see it another time. It’s definitely my 2nd favorite movie of the year. (My favorite movie of the year is of course that other small Marvel movie Guardians of the Galaxy vol 2)
Be sure to check back next week for a spoiler filled review.
I recommend this movie A LOT!! It’s a 10 out of 10!!!

A graceful presence in that film, his revenge mission and the way he acted about it, with his seemingly calm and collected point of view, turned him into an interested new addition to that film and the _MCU_. After this, I felt I wasn’t really in need of another origin story, or a story that generally felt like a “character beginning�?.

With that in mind, I think _Black Panther_ was the ideal film for where we are right now with the _MCU_. Rather than a beginning, it continues T’Challa’s story almost directly from where we left off, but with a particular focus on bringing us into Wakanda and showing us what the destination has to offer… which is a lot. Hidden in plain sight (and appropriately referred to as “El Dorado�? once in the film), it’s an absolutely stunning metropolis filled with incredibly advanced technology which apparently extends to all aspects of life.

What made the Wakandans interesting for me was the fact that they don’t show some sort of “sci-fi�? character behaviour despite the futuristic advancements. Society remains deeply rooted into traditions, which is shown predominantly through the process of succession to the throne with the challenges presented to the heir. Aspects of daily life in the city appear to be “normal�? enough, creating a rather unique blend of the most advanced technologies on Earth with present-day mentalities and cultures (such as their clothing/body features). It’s the ultimate in representation within a word heavy on science fiction.

The film has the necessary tie-ins you would expect, which are not too many so that it can exist and sustain itself on its own legs (personally, I couldn’t say the same for _Spider-Man: Homecoming_, for instance). Other than our hero, we have the return of Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) as a secondary antagonist, having more importance here than in his previous appearances; and Everett Ross (Martin Freeman) echoing our eyes within Wakanda.

I suppose the biggest issue the film deals with is the hidden status of Wakanda. Though the majority of its citizens agree with it remaining hidden (and so it has been since the very beginning of the Vibranium development), others support revealing everything to the world, with the argument that all the advancements can be used to the benefit of black people across the globe as a weapon against oppression. In the middle of this, we have the main villain, Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), eager to allow Wakanda to become public as soon as he gets his hands (or _claws_) on the throne. The backstory and reasoning behind his actions turn him into a more compelling villain than a lot of previous, _MCU_ villains.

Given the importance of following traditions set by ancient tribes, this works in their detriment, as Killmonger (which sounds better than “Iron Monger�?) could simply swoop in, take over and immediately make decisions that affect everyone despite hundreds of years of history – it’s pure dictatorship, yet you can’t help but see his perspective as someone who was wronged by the Wakandans and their laws when he was but a small child. Now, after a life of war, all he does is use those very same laws against the ones who have been upholding them for centuries. The tensions created were good to watch, although the support Killmonger received from a whole sector of Wakanda came way too easily. Yes, it’s hard to argue against efficiency when Killmonger simply waltz in with Klaue’s body, something two Kings haven’t been able to accomplish – but I disliked how W’Kabi (_Get Out_’s Daniel Kaluuya) went from being T’Challa’s friend and supporter to fiercely opposing all about him within seconds.

Something very strange about _Black Panther_ is that despite being a superhero movie with the titular character, it feels more like “Wakanda: The Movie�?. And something I did feel was that after roughly a third of the film goes by, it feels like T’Challa somehow loses protagonism. In hindsight, other than some visually great fight scenes, I didn’t feel like there was something that specifically singled out T’Challa as the main character other than being “the heir�?. What I mean is, as good as he was as Black Panther, I didn’t feel like he had enough moments to really shine – if anything, all characters surrounding him outshone him when Wakanda was in trouble. I think I was left with a more lasting impression of the character after _Civil War_ than here, despite really liking the film.

Overall, I was happy. The only aspect I disliked, which I almost didn’t want to bring up, were the Disney comedy bits. I know at this point we just have to deal with it as it isn’t really something that goes away… but that comedy takes me out of the film instantly. Maybe there weren’t as many as in other films and I didn’t really mind the funny scenes with the sister – I’m not opposed to the designated “funny character�? – but to me the rest were cringeworthy, such as M’Baku’s jokes (Winston Duke, who was Dominic in _Person of Interest_!!) after T’Challa was healed, which just felt off-character to me. But well, I suppose the majority of audiences respond well to it (in my viewing everyone was laughing their ass off).

I''m sure you''ve heard many times so far how extraordinary it was for a _Marvel_ movie, I don''t want to tell you one more time. I just tell you what my perceptions were in good and in bad ways as well.

_Wakanda_ is an imaginary country. Firstly, because this place obviously doesn’t exist. Secondly, because it''s a unique way how African-Americans think about Africa nowadays. I mean under that they still have bad feelings and fear about how the colonists have exploited them for their rich natural sources and have divided the continent many dependencies. So the reason why they want to stay isolated for everything and everyone is totally acceptable. They own a high technology now which is wanted to keep for themselves. All in all, they absolutely don''t want become victims again.

We can agree _Killmonger_ was the best _Marvel_ villain or at least he''s in the top 3. He has a rightful reason behind his motives, and what he wants to accomplish. His hatred toward the people of _Wakanda_ is well-established, because the former _Black Panther_ basically made him orphan, and abandoned him, which clearly caused him serious trauma. Then, he''s kept his whole life in wars, which made his judgment worse.

Also absolutely amazing they''ve kept their ancient rituals besides their technological development, which had some issues in my opinion. On the one hand, because it seemed so stereotypical but that wasn''t the main reason. The rules of these rituals weren''t crystal clear to me. How the descendent of the king is succeeded on the throne. At first blink I thought the king''s first born son is the one, who follows him on the throne that''s why _T''Chala''s_ came back to _Wakanda_.   Then, pursuant to a ritual, he had to conquer of his challengers. Wasn''t clear to me there is some law for dealing with these kind of questions. These two ideas are just in collusion.
However, this didn''t ruin the experience.

Black Panther in itself is not a really interesting superhero, but Marvel has proved in the past that it did not mean that the movie had to be dull. Captain America is even less interesting than Black Panther, but they managed to work around that by making the movies not about him but rather integrate them as a major plot arc in the MCU. No such thing here.

Actually the opposite, they tried to make it NOT a superhero movie. So you get your _James Bond_ scene, your _Fast and Furious_ scene, your _Independance day_ scene, but not that many _Marvel_ scenes. I think it lost its way by trying to look more blockbustery.

There are several good points, **the movie isn''t bad, it''s just uninteresting**. The whole middle half of the movie was actually boring.

The cast in general is good. The fight scenes are generally ok. The Wakanda city looks really impressive from afar. Too bad you never actually see it. Visually, everything is pretty neat (if you don''t mind CGI everywhere, I don''t).

Of the main characters, Shuri is definitively the more interesting. She''s Bond''s Q, but alot livelier and funnier. You also see her much more as you would another Q type character as she''s also the main character''s sister. Her role in Wakanda is huge. She seems to be the main engineer, urban designer, lead inventor, the vibranium reference expert, and all by herself as we never see anyone working in this huge lab. She seems also to be the person to go to when you need a doctor, instead of say, an hospital. That''s maybe a little too much, but it''s not like there are no equivalent in Marvel universe. Definitely would love to see her working with Stark and Banner.

The best character by far, although in a way too minor role, is Klaue. It seems he could have been one of the best villain of the whole MCU. Extremely original, fun, half crazy with a Joker-like vibe, every one of his scene was perfect. On a similar vibe, M''baku turned out to be a pretty cool [spoiler]vegetarian :)[/spoiler] character.

[spoiler]So it sucked when he was quickly dispatched to be used as an entrance ticket to Wakanda.[/spoiler] But Killmonger is actually a pretty cool antagonist too, obviously a lot less fun and original, but still. That is, if you totally ignore the ending [spoiler]where he turns out to be a little child crying on the inside that was just mean because he wanted his daddy and see a sunset in his homeland.[/spoiler] COME ON ! Seriously ??  Way to fuck up an otherwise ok character.

The others are less interesting. Okoye is the cliche super loyal royal guard. Her husband sucks (what a waste of a good actor). Nakia is sold as an interesting character, but apart from [spoiler]picking up the plant[/spoiler], I don''t think she does anything. Forest Whitaker plays Forest Whitaker as usual, a little less crazy, a little more mystical, but that''s it. Martin Freeman''s character looks like he could be interesting but firstly it''s a little biased (because what character wouldn''t be interesting with Martin Freeman ?) and secondly here he''s mostly used to make the point that the token white guy should know to stay in his place when the black leads know best. I loved whrn it was mentioned that he was a foreign agent, with a duty to report what he saw, that''s something that''s usually blatantly ignored for plot reasons in this kind of situations. He wouldn''t be a very good agent, or even person, if he didn''t do his job. However, after that, nobody ever think of it again, least of all himself.

The plot, it can even be called that, was pretty weak. The intro scene looked cool. The whole Wakandian ceremonial stuff (which makes a huge part of the movie) is ridiculous. The casino scene was a rip-off of a rip-off of a Bond movie. The car chase was ok looking but boring. I kept waiting for the real story to start. The only time where a little story happens is when [spoiler]Killmonger takes power and Nakia and co go to find M''Baku[/spoiler]. The final fight was ok, but a long way to be on level with other Marvels. The ID4 scene is totally out of place. The final duel is disappointing as it''s in a full CGI place that''s totally unadapted to make use of their powers.

There''s a minor point about the place of Wakanda in the world, but it''s just extremist protectionism, staying hidden not matter what, on one side, that goes directly to "let''s conquer the whole world" on the other. Nobody seems to have though anything else about it until then.

A little plus: the kinetic energy absorption/emission added into the suit allows some really cool effects and fight actions, the only thing making it a little interesting. However he [spoiler]doesn''t even use it against Killmonger when it''s the one advantage his suit has over the other''s. And what''s the point of activating the train and the suit disabling thingie, they don''t even fight once when it''s on.[/spoiler]

And a huge issue for me. I really don''t buy Wakanda. Asgard actually makes more sense than Wakanda.
1) First the obvious: nobody knows about it. So no neighbouring country ever tried to go there. And nobody saw any sign of it growing. Because it should have been already pretty huge by the time they invented a technology that allowed to cloak the entire country!

2) They have vibranium, sure. But they don''t sell it or exchange with other countries. Which means they are also self sufficient on absolutely everything else.

3) They''re total non interventionist. So war and famine in other african countries ? Nope. World wars with tens of millions of deaths ? Nope. An alien race attacks the planet and they''re the only ones with an equivalent level technology ? Nope. What a bunch of assholes.

4) We have a nice view of arriving in Wakanda, and then that''s it. We never see the city. Well there''s a scene where they walk in small streets full of dust, but that hardly fit with the skyscraper''s skyline. Why would they keep streets this way with their technology.

5) Even if technology evolved, it does not seem the society did. Lots of antiquated tribal rituals and decorum. The kind of stuff that a society that advanced should leave behind. I mean sure it''s fun for children and costumes and the once in a while ceremony, but advanced society usually get rid pretty quickly of superstition and religious ceremonial bullshit. The most important point of that being:

6) They still haven''t been able to figure out that maybe, just maybe, having two half naked guys fight to the death with spears on a waterfall is _not_ the best way to choose a leader ? Also the king~god thing. Isn''t that weird when everybody knows that it''s just due to a technology that only the royals have access to ?

7) They still need to collect the heart shaped herb and crush it with a mortar ? They haven''t found a way to extract the active element, industrialize it, even synthesize it as it''s vibranium based ? [spoiler]Though they probably miraculously will now, as it''s supposedly completely gone.[/spoiler]

Storywise it''s definitely the weakest of the MCU. Because it looks good and I really enjoyed Shuri and Klaue, I''d rank it slightly above Iron Man 2 and Thor 2, but the only other time I felt bored watching a MCU movie was the Captain America part of Civil War, and the first half more than made up for it.

First and foremost this movie is a superhero backstory movie. I had to keep this in mind because I was distracted and put off by poorly written, undeveloped sub-themes. As much as it presented itself as African proud, a hidden culture built on science, technology and the idea of supercities, cloaked under rural Africa, there were constant failed attempts to connect these characters to the American Black experience, so much so they lost track of their own backstory. For example, toward the end of the movie there is a moment when a sympathetic villain thinks he is about to die and he defiantly says, something to the effect of, "throw me into the ocean as so many of my ancestors chose to die rather than to live in bondage!"  This character''s ancestors were never enslaved and shipped to America, his father went from a palace to America as a spy, and, he himself was an offspring of an aristocratic super society.  So I hope you won''t be distracted, as I was, from the driving force of the film which is the rise of a superhero, a celebration of heroism, strength and justice - the anthem of superheros.

It wasn''t earth shatteringly good, but it was a very nice change-of-pace from the usual superhero movies, especially those coming from Marvel. The entire setting of Wakanda was just amazingly done and is honestly the real star of the film. Black Panther has got its whole own mythos, culture, and set of vibes/themes that really sets it apart from the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I really dug the entire look and feel of the movie.

The story was pretty solid as well. Very-Shakespearean as others have described with family, betrayal, royalty, etc. I liked what they did in terms of the villain with Michael B. Jordan and how things progressed, but I feel like just a little something was missing in the last third of the movie or so. Perhaps the conflict could have allowed to develop a bit more intensely, and then we could have gotten a story that was truly special. Instead, we get a solid redemption story type thing at the end. I don''t really know what could have been added or changed to the story (that''s why I''m not directing a multimillion dollar movie), but I feel like something truly epic could have materialized (albeit time restraints are a real thing as well).

Anyway, **Black Panther** was still a great movie, and very much part of its **own** universe. I actually liked this path that Marvel took for Black Panther by limiting the Marvel cameos and trailers/lead-ins to other movies as much as possible, and rather focusing on the characters and people of THIS movie.

Yes, it has the allies and enemies we’ve met in prior movies like *Age of Ultron* and *Civil War*. It has the jovial vibe among its main cast. And it has the mandatory, climactic third act battle, draped in CGI and the usual fanfare.

But it also stands apart from the rest of the MCU’s offerings. It is unabashedly Afrocentric in its focus and its approach. It is a plainly political film, meditating on the legacy of colonialism, the oppression of people of color around the world, and the push and pull of isolationism vs. global activism. Though squeezed into the standard, three act superhero structure, *Black Panther* takes its audience to a different space, one untouched by the rest of the world and, in some ways, untouched by the broader cinematic universe the film acts in concert with.

It is a uniquely, profoundly black take on the modern superhero film, one long overdue, if for no other reason than how it breathes new life into the familiar formula. There’s nothing wrong with comic book movies hitting certain standard notes of uncertainty, challenge, and self-realization. But *Black Panther* is a cinematic argument for broadening the franchise, showing the renewed, distinctive character these common stories take on, when they’re told from a fully-formed, confident, and different perspective.

That distinct atmosphere is the best thing about the film, alongside the clear camaraderie among its cast and characters. No hero is an island these days, and while the title character has a notable arc that’s done well, the most enjoyable portions of the movie emerge when the plot mechanics of that arc are set aside for Black Panther to chat, spark, and laugh with his tech-wiz sister Shuri (Letitia Wright), his altruistic ex Nakia (Lupita Nyong''o), and his fierce, principled guard Okoye (Danai Gurira). So much of these films depends on the chemistry and connection between the people the audience is asked to spend two hours with, and *Black Panther* soars on that front, building a rapport among those core characters that carries the day.

 At the same time, Chadwick Boseman gives one of the best dramatic performances to grace a Marvel film. Thematically, the film centers on the notion of whether someone with a kind heart but also uncertainty about how and where to guide his people can be a good leader, and Boseman brings the inherent decency and heft to make these ideas land.

*Black Panther* constantly puts its title character between conflicting choices and impulses. T’Challa has to balance his inherent sense of mercy, shown to the leader of a challenging tribe, with his desire to deliver swift justice, shown when he threatens enemy of the state Ulysses Klaue in public. He has to reconcile his deep love for his father and his deep respect for his people’s traditions with his growing realizations that his forebears were men, not gods, who made mistakes, and that his homeland may need to change and evolve. He must square his country’s tradition of isolation, with the competing calls to share the nation’s wealth and knowledge in order to help those in need, or to use those resources to bring down the oppressors around the world who keep them in that state.

If there’s one area where *Black Panther* excels, it’s in creating a central character who’s pulled in multiple directions, on multiple dimensions, leaving him unsure what path to take and what sort of man to be, until the right direction is forged in fires of challenge and hardship. The film is a political story, a cultural story, a family story, and a personal story.

It’s just that Coogler and co-writer Joe Robert Cole seem not particularly interested in it being a superhero story. That’s not necessarily a problem. Films as tonally diverse as *Logan* and *Deadpool* have shown you can use the superhero framework to craft a multitude of different films with different approaches within the superhero framework. But there’s a sense in *Black Panther* that the comic book-y elements are perfunctory, that Coogler and Cole had a compelling story to tell about legacy, power, and obligation, couldn’t tell it without including the de jure superhero fireworks.

*Black Panther* is at its best when it shows its title character confronting his responsibilities as a citizen, son, and leader, or finding strength, challenge, and affection among his friends and family. And it’s at its weakest when it shows him punching and kicking those things in comic book movies that inevitably must be punched and kicked.

At times, Coogler and director of photography Rachel Morrison capture the same sort of raw intensity of combat that hews close to a boxing match from *Creed*. The close quarters combat of the challenges for leadership are tight and visceral, giving an immediate sense of the personalities clashing at the same time bodies are, and a digitally-stitched but nominally unbroken action sequence early in the film has the energy and fluidity of a splash page. But too often, the film’s fight sequences are a big jumble, edited to bits and nigh-impossible to follow from one blow to the next. Worse yet, the CGI is especially in these sequence -- digital characters move without weight, animated creatures and vehicles disrupt the immersion of a scene, and climactic fights between fully computer-generated figures in a computer-generated world feel like gameplay clips pulled from *Mortal Kombat*.

Despite the strength of the story that ends in that skirmish, the film ostensibly breaks little new ground in terms of its narrative. Notably, Marvel’s own *Thor* trilogy covers much of the same territory, from the prince questioning his place as king, to far off lands debating the appropriate level of engagement with the outside world, to unruly yet sympathetic relatives with an appetite to conquer angling for the throne.

But what makes *Black Panther* so refreshing is the perspective from which it approaches this material. There is a richness to the cultural wellspring that Coogler and his team draw from, one underutilized in big budget filmmaking. The film is rife with different hues, different pleasures and sore sports, that inform the movie’s sensibilities even as it applies them to the smash-and-then-find-yourself routine that the Marvel origin movies have nigh-perfected at this point.

It’s the critic’s crutch to see a film’s story as a metaphor for the film itself. And yet it’s hard not to see parallels between the story of T’Challa deciding to bring Wakanda into the rest of the world, and Coogler deciding to bring his *Black Panther* into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. One of the wonderful things about the MCU is the way that it can create a cohesive sense of place among different films, and foster the sense, through minor easter eggs and the occasional team-up, that all of these events are taking place in the same world.

But despite having a few of those continuity nods and connections, *Black Panther* feels like it occupies a world all its own, one full of its own color, character, and vibrancy. At the end of the movie, T’Challa opts for outreach, he decides to open Wakanda’s borders, and share his nation’s knowledge and culture with the world. With this film, Ryan Coogler &amp; Co. do the same for Marvel, telling their own story in their own, but also bringing such a distinctiveness and a specificity to it that makes the world of these films a deeper, richer, better place for *Black Panther*’s presence within it.', 'ACED00057372000D6A6176612E74696D652E536572955D84BA1B2248B20C00007870770A05000007E20211131BE378', null, 0, 763266179, 0.006128986113464672, 0.00000008367378226297442, 'SUBJECTIVE', 0.9999984005101448, 'POSITIVE', 0.9938709302127531, 0.9938709302127531, 'Trakt', 'https://trakt.tv/comments/162407', 1);

¯\_(ツ)_/¯

No, but... really... this movie was the eye-candiest of them all.
There is NO objection whatsoever (from me) about this.

The picture was SYMMETRICAL PERFECTION.
Color palette was ORGASMIC.
Everything that is related to visuals was a 10/10.

Some of the shots were straight up MAJESTIC. The camera angles, the production, the way everything is placed was on point.
It was so mesmerizing at some point it looked like Wakanda actually existed.
The culture so vivid, so beautifully crafted and mixed to real life beautiful african culture.

Music, perfectly mixed between traditional african and current african-american. DRUMS! DRUMS ALL THE TIME!
It was not a bland, glorification of the relation between black people and hip-hop music.
It was a perfect and ear-gasmic balance of the two.

But... but, but but... it does fall short, and it''s mainly because of movie scripting.

The story finds some difficuly into forging itself into something that is unique. You can clearly see the tentative but it does fail, it''s not your simple superhero movie story, but it''s not even a big sociological message, it''s a weird combination of the two, at times wrongly mixed and neither one of them actually leaves you with the feeling the movie is actually over, it needs more. The part between the start and the end was a hit and a miss.

What this movie did horribly wrong - despite all previous Marvel movies - was the comedic part of it.
And you could really tell after you get to see a "Vine meme" inside a major feature film. All it needed for me to be completely disappointed was a "Deez nuts" joke. Gladly, Marvel is owned by Disney.

At the end of the day, for peace of mind, it was a very pleasurable experience and it deserves to be seen.

Wakanda itself is an unofficial character in the film with a rich visual palette and identity. It''s people, along with most visuals in the movie, are brightly coloured and looks like an.artists dream, as rich and colourful as the comics that spawned them.

All the principle and supporting cast bring it.
