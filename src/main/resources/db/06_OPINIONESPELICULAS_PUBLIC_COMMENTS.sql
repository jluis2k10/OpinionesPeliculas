Deadpool is at its best when it''s making fun of superhero movies. The film feels like a counter-reaction to the prominence and seriousness of comic book films in pop culture, and in that vein, it''s a success. When it fills the opening credits with a description of its actors rather than their actual names (e.g. "Moody Teen", "British Villain"), features knowing winks to its star''s emerald-tinged prior efforts as a cape, and plays "Angel of the Morning" behind its freeze-framed mayhem, it''s a statement of purpose, an indication from the very beginning that this is not going to be your standard superhero flick, and the movie is very much in on the joke.

And yet the movie is at its weakest when it gives into that seriousness, when it hits the usual beats of a standard good guy origin story, including a bland baddie and lost love. The film does its best to throw in a comedic riff on these moments, with playful quips directed at the film''s villain, even as he cycles through the requisite bad guy threats and intimidation routine, and ribald remarks permeating the tragic backstory and romance. It''s a firm attempt to try to take some of the edge off of bland baddie Ajax (Ed Skrein) and his wooden, generic henchman Angel Dust (Gina Carano), who are the most standard-issue characters in the film. But at its core, Deadpool can''t completely run away from the typical superhero movie rhythms it employs, even as it''s trying to make fun of them, and that drags it down in the moments where the film tries to be a little more conventional or serious.

Thankfully, the lead character provides plenty of comedic juice, both in the suit and outside of it. Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) is effectively a murderous Bugs Bunny, causing mayhem that looks like some cross between Kill Bill and Tex Avery. Reynolds nails the characters charming irreverence, and the script belies any attempts to show a true heart of gold beneath the barrage of bullets and sarcastic asides.

If anything, Deadpool goes too far in the other direction, having its lead repeatedly affirm that he is not, in fact, a hero -- that he is, instead, just a bad guy who goes after people who are worse. That''s a great premise for a character, and the fact that the film doesn''t shy away from its R-rating or from showing Deadpool plying his trade with little care or concern for Truth, Justice, and The American Way. But having him vocalize that point repeatedly makes Deadpool himself feel more like the rebellious teenager who makes a point to constantly remind you that he doesn''t care.

Despite that, in the moments where Deadpool avoids the pitfalls of backstory fatigue and rescue mission malaise, it is a delightfully breezy, eminently enjoyable film. Director Tim Miller perfectly captures the screwball, irreverent tone necessary for the piece to work, from his main character''s looney mayhem, to the comedic exchanges between Deadpool and his wife Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), buddy (T.J. Miller), and roommate (Leslie Uggams), all of which have their own distinct flavor and weird, off-color charms.

Make no mistake, Deadpool is a film that wears its raunchiness on its sleeve. Reynolds'' history as Van Wilder served him well for the movie''s puerile sensibilities, culminating in a parade of horribles game of oneupsmanship that serves as both his and Vanessa''s meetcute and their reconciliation. The movie is not above making jokes about sex, masturbation, and genitalia in general. To that end, the script has the feel of the standard X-Men outing grafted into a Robot Chicken sketch. I''m certainly not too classy to enjoy the film''s thoroughly juvenile charms, and the unabashed way it embraces its sophomoric, self-mocking tone keeps things light and fun.

The film also preserves Deadpool''s fourth wall-breaking asides. It''s a delicate balance, and staying on the right side of the Ferris Bueler line is no small feet. But when Deadpool talks to the audience about who he had to pleasure to get his own movie, or cautions that his suit shouldn''t be green or animated, or complains about his confusion as to which actor is playing Professor X at this point in the timeline, it''s another sign that the film is having fun with the excesses of the genre and his X-men Universe stablemates. Too much of that post-modern take on comedy can be grating, but Miller parcels out just enough to make it a treat instead of a gimmick.

In many ways, Deadpool feels like the raunchier cousin of Guardians of the Galaxy. Both films feature a less-than-savory protagonist; both trade in classic tunes played over silly action scenes; and both attempt to undercut any necessary serious moments with a joke and subvert the big comic book ending just enough to add-in an enjoyable twist that tells the audience what kind of a franchise this is and what kind of a "hero" they''re dealing with. Guardians is a bit more earnest in the effort, and certainly tamer by comparison, but both films prove that you can make a superhero movie that is as much of a comedy as it is an action-adventure tale, regardless of where the humor is pitched.

Deadpool does revel in its sense of subversion. The main character pushes back at Colossus''s moralizing about becoming a hero (and ribs his teenage sidekick for her sullen silences and sharp remarks in one of the film''s funniest bits). And just when it seems like he''s about to give in and spare his enemy, Deadpool shoots the guy point blank, right in the middle of the metal man''s speech. That type of attitude, that eschews the usual tropes of crime-fighting stories and throws in a ribald quip for good measure, makes Deadpool a refreshing, often hilarious enterprise that knows what it wants to be and doesn''t hold back. If only it could sustain that energy and aim throughout the film, rather than devolving, at times, into damsels in distress and a typical revenge tale with a checkered past tacked on for good measure, it would succeed unequivocally. Instead, Deadpool is a tremendously funny film with a delightful comedic verve that sustains it from beginning to end, even if, occasionally, it can''t quite escape the baggage of its super suit-wearing brethren.

Reynolds nails the characters charming irreverence , and the script belies any attempts to show a true heart of gold beneath the barrage of bullets and sarcastic asides . If anything , Deadpool goes too far in the other direction , having its lead repeatedly affirm that he is not , in fact , a hero -- that he is , instead , just a bad guy who goes after people who are worse . That '' s a great premise for a character , and the fact that the film doesn '' t shy away from its R-rating or from showing Deadpool plying his trade with little care or concern for Truth , Justice , and The American Way . But having him vocalize that point repeatedly makes Deadpool himself feel more like the rebellious teenager who makes a point to constantly remind you that he doesn '' t care . Despite that , in the moments where Deadpool avoids the pitfalls of backstory fatigue and rescue mission malaise , it is a delightfully breezy , eminently enjoyable film . Director Tim Miller perfectly captures the screwball , irreverent tone necessary for the piece to work , from his main character '' s looney mayhem , to the comedic exchanges between Deadpool and his wife Vanessa ( Morena Baccarin ) , buddy ( T . J . Miller ) , and roommate ( Leslie Uggams ) , all of which have their own distinct flavor and weird , off-color charms . Make no mistake , Deadpool is a film that wears its raunchiness on its sleeve . Reynolds '' history as Van Wilder served him well for the movie '' s puerile sensibilities , culminating in a parade of horribles game of oneupsmanship that serves as both his and Vanessa '' s meetcute and their reconciliation . The movie is not above making jokes about sex , masturbation , and genitalia in general . To that end , the script has the feel of the standard X-Men outing grafted into a Robot Chicken sketch . I '' m certainly not too classy to enjoy the film '' s thoroughly juvenile charms , and the unabashed way it embraces its sophomoric , self-mocking tone keeps things light and fun . The film also preserves Deadpool '' s fourth wall-breaking asides . It '' s a delicate balance , and staying on the right side of the Ferris Bueler line is no small feet . But when Deadpool talks to the audience about who he had to pleasure to get his own movie , or cautions that his suit shouldn '' t be green or animated , or complains about his confusion as to which actor is playing Professor X at this point in the timeline , it '' s another sign that the film is having fun with the excesses of the genre and his X-men Universe stablemates . Too much of that post-modern take on comedy can be grating , but Miller parcels out just enough to make it a treat instead of a gimmick . In many ways , Deadpool feels like the raunchier cousin of Guardians of the Galaxy . Both films feature a less-than-savory protagonist ; both trade in classic tunes played over silly action scenes ; and both attempt to undercut any necessary serious moments with a joke and subvert the big comic book ending just enough to add-in an enjoyable twist that tells the audience what kind of a franchise this is and what kind of a " hero " they '' re dealing with . Guardians is a bit more earnest in the effort , and certainly tamer by comparison , but both films prove that you can make a superhero movie that is as much of a comedy as it is an action-adventure tale , regardless of where the humor is pitched . Deadpool does revel in its sense of subversion . The main character pushes back at Colossus '' s moralizing about becoming a hero ( and ribs his teenage sidekick for her sullen silences and sharp remarks in one of the film '' s funniest bits ) . And just when it seems like he '' s about to give in and spare his enemy , Deadpool shoots the guy point blank , right in the middle of the metal man '' s speech . That type of attitude , that eschews the usual tropes of crime-fighting stories and throws in a ribald quip for good measure , makes Deadpool a refreshing , often hilarious enterprise that knows what it wants to be and doesn '' t hold back . If only it could sustain that energy and aim throughout the film , rather than devolving , at times , into damsels in distress and a typical revenge tale with a checkered past tacked on for good measure , it would succeed unequivocally . Instead , Deadpool is a tremendously funny film with a delightful comedic verve that sustains it from beginning to end , even if , occasionally , it can '' t quite escape the baggage of its super suit-wearing brethren .', 5, 0.9999999999999416, 0.00000000000005833612086772325, 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005801243281357181);

Deadpool (aka Wade Wilson) is a hero/villain out for revenge/fun in the most entertaining way possible.  Think the Punisher crossed with a clown (maybe even the clown from Stephen Kings It).

As far as making a film about Deadpool goes, I walked in with very little confidence, but a bucket load of hope.  The comics are fun, but the amount of convention breaking that happens, and the general tone of the pieces, should have made for a LOT of problems in capturing an audience, and trying to have some manner of plot.  But what we got was a pleasant surprise.  As expected fourth walls were broken (this appeared to be the marketing slogan at times for the film in interviews), f-bombs were dropped, and there was enough blood and splats to question whether the 15 rating in the UK should have been an 18.  I think the only way it got the 18 was because the gore was so comically daft, that no-one could be truly grossed out by it.  But then, if you look at the BBFC notes, it says "strong bloody violence, strong language, sex references".  I think the word very is used extremely loosely here, also ''sex references'' should probably just say drop the word ''references'' altogether.

The way the film pans out as a piece is, at times, a little more generic than some Deadpool fans would have wanted (damsel in distress, bad-times-mutation, flashbacks), but it still did it''s best at trying to break these conventions anyway.  What with the bad-times-mutation being some rather nasty torture, or that the damsel-in-distress is pretty bad-ass themselves, I think we can forgive it''s sins here.  After all, without these conventions, we may have ended up with the sketch-show style I went in concerned about.  Also, as many other reviews have noted, there were budgetary constrains on this film which threatened a family friendly rating.  But these constraints aided in getting the sub 2-hour film we get, and some of the jokes are directed at this too, pulling no punches.

But as a review, the film was great fun to watch, and at less than 2 hours (which is always a blessing with an action-comedy),  I would certainly recommend going to watch it to others, so long as all the notes I made above haven''t put you off.  The only downside left for me is that I now have to discuss this film with my mum tonight, with no idea how that will go, or what questions will be asked of me.

Now we just have to await the sequel, and so long as the budget isn''t high, Reynolds is back, and we have a certain silver-haired cyborg from the future, I will be happy.

Está claro que los Nolan, o te encantan o los odias, y a mí me encantan. Es una película de ciencia ficción, pero que juega mucho con los valores humanos, con lo mejor y lo peor de nosotros mismos, y sobretodo con el esfuerzo por hacer las cosas mejor, y el sentido de la supervivencia. Hay momentos de "paranoia" (en plan "too many drugs brothers"...) pero que se acoplan con momentos de claridad total de ideas, y la mezcla de ciencia con ficción está muy bien conseguida.

Great acting, interesting screenplay, great graphics, lots of hardcore science done "right", great emotions.

Plot: (minor spoilers)
Earth is dying. Humans are trying to survive, but crops fail them and they face extinction. Their only chance of survival is finding new planet that is habitable. This is possible due to warmhole located near Saturn. Scouts have been sent in past to explore several options, but due to communication fault one more mission needs to be sent to confirm the right planet.

Story: (medium spoilers)
Copper (Matthew McConaughey; story protagonist) is a father, ex NASA pilot, living with his family as farmers, trying to survive by producing last grow-able food corn. He cares deeply for his children, but upon discovering NASA hidden station he faces decision to go to space, to find/confirm new planet human race could live on.

What the protagonist wants in the movie from the start is to get back. This is for me interesting screenplay. Cooper decision to go to space was almost given to him. He know that was what he needed to do, what he was born and trained to do. Saving human race for me is the background of the story. He promises to his daughter (Murphy) that he will return to see her.

She is his relationship character. She wants him to stay with them, not to go. Something that the protagonists fails to see in fullest, he know he wants it, but puts it aside for greater good, the mission. This part is important for the emotional side of story and is very strong!

As for antagonist: this is the universe, and the physical laws. Mainly time relativity. The movie nicely depicts the realities of any possible space travel and its implication to our exposure to time. This is the main obstacle to the antagonist to reconcile with his goal, to go back, to see his daughter, because she would die of old age before he would return back. So he is racing against the time, will he make it?

My summary and opinion:
Really great movie mainly due to screenplay that is well executed by actors and cinematics. Main strength i see in the "hidden" true story, that coincides with the fore-front story of saving human race. The resolution of the movie is well timed to coincide in three elements getting reconciled (The antagonist goal, the saving of human race, and emotional reconciliation with the relationship character (daughter) )

In "Interstellar", a film written and directed by Christopher Nolan,
climate change has decimated most of the world''s food supplies.
Towns are regularly ravaged by fierce sand storms, and
everything is covered with thick layers of dust.

A very select group of scientists set out to embark
on humanities most ambitious mission: travel through
a newly discovered wormhole into another galaxy.
They hope of collecting the necessary data to either move
many people onto a new experimental gravitation spaceship, or find a new Earth altogether.

I have now watched this movie twice at an IMAX.
After my first viewing, when the credits rolled,
I sat there perplexed and was unable to move. I was paralysed
by what I had seen. I looked around, I was not the only one.
Unquestionably, one of the greatest movies I had ever seen.
I was almost ashamed to admit it, because it felt like I had no
say in this decision whatsoever.
There are many moments when "Interstellar" transcends into
something so artistic, you are left speechless and are moved to tears.

The cinematography and directing is, even by Nolan''s standards,
his best work so far. I think his talent is even too profound for
the Academy of Motion Pictures, hence why he has yet to receive an oscar
for directing. Personally, after watching "Interstellar", I consider
him to be the best director that is currently alive, only rivalled
by Kubrick and Hitchcock.

Hans Zimmer wrote the score and I really recommend to read how
he translated Nolan''s fantastic ideas into music.
I get goosebumps just thinking about the high-speed docking scene,
and you will, too! The sound engineers did an amazing job contrasting
the cosmic silence with Zimmer''s incredibly ethereal music.
During the rocket launch, the entire theatre shook and you were
really feeling the thrust.

If I was forced to describe the score, I would say it was
heavily influenced by Johann Strauß, Philip Glass and Bach.
Truly a masterpiece that deserves to be revisited many times and
among all the great soundtracks he has ever done, this is simply
on an entirely different level. His most intimate work.

The visual effects were breathtaking - quite literally.
The on-screen silence during certain parts of the movie
was only rivalled by the complete and utter silence
of my fellow IMAX watchers. Nobody said a word, nobody moved.
Just hundreds of mesmerized people staring at the screen,
or digging their fingers into their armrests during
some of the most tense moments I have ever seen.

"Interstellar" depicts astrophysical concepts that
have never been seen or discussed on-screen before.
"Awesome", in its most literal sense, really describes it.

When I set out to write this review, I really tried to
avoid superlatives, and give you a more nuanced opinion
of why I think this movie deserves to be ranked among
the best, but I now see how I have failed.

I recommend to watch "Interstellar" at an IMAX,
or the best movie theatre around you.
It''s not something you should rent at a Red Box or watch on Netflix.

To start with, the opening was very clunky. Obviously some exposition was necessary but it wasn''t done naturally at all. Here, meet Cooper, just your average, every day engineer-scientist-quantum-physicist-drone-programmer-explorer-pioneer-farmer-pilot. Avoiding information dumps isn''t really either Nolan''s strong suit and while later on, especially on the space ship, expository dialogue is definitely necessary considering the subject matter, it still comes across as awkward. Cooper is occasionally an expert on things that should be beyond him (which, of course, he conveniently explains for you), while at other times he''s completely clueless about things that he should really know about in his position (which, of course, somebody else conveniently explains for you). Cooper isn''t the only one guilty of this though, everybody else on the spaceship likewise seem very ill-prepared for such a trip.

Speaking of characters who aren''t Cooper, everybody else''s characterisation is terrible. You don''t know anything at all about two members of the crew, and somehow you''re meant to care about one of their completely avoidable deaths (come on, he got to the ship first, he could have easily gotten in without getting in the way of TARS)? Somehow you''re also meant to care about My Cocaine''s death (which I''ll get to in a moment) because he''s a father of somebody? They''re not even shown to have a close relationship or anything, it seemed more just an excuse to make a big reveal (which I''ll also get to in a moment). His daughter, Anne Hathaway''s character, also doesn''t seem to have much of a personality until it turns out that hey, she''s actually in love with this person you''ve never met. Even this "aspect" of her otherwise bland character seems to just have been added in as a lazy way to flesh her out and add unnecessary conflict. On the subject of unnecessary conflict, both the children, Murph and Tom, make really irrational decisions. When Murph tells Tom that he should move to save his family, he gets really upset because... who knows? And then even though he''s given up hope on his dad, it''s magically all okay later on when, after burning his crops, Murph tells him some nonsense about "hey, it was him all along, it was him, our father *sob*". Prior to that of course, Murph''s been holding a grudge against Cooper for like three decades, even though she knew for a large chunk of that what he was up to, after she began work at NASA. This relationship gets all sorted out when she has her magical realisation that the ghost was Cooper all along even though that''s just a huge leap of faith and there''s nothing to indicate that might be the case, unless, of course, it was ~love~ (which, yes, I''ll get to in a moment too).

Back to the death bed scene. It had terrible sound mixing as you struggled to understand what My Cocaine was saying at all, but even worse it lacked any emotional significance as mentioned above, instead serving to make the reveal that he never wanted to go with Plan A all along. Of course, like all final words, it also ends with a very convenient moment where, instead of letting Murph know that her father didn''t know anything about this, he decides to recite a poem because you gotta have that pointless ambiguity and conflict. This big reveal about it ends up removing any tension that might have happened when you get told the same twist later by Matt Damon; there''s no emotional impact as you were just told that ten minutes ago and you''ve had that whole time to let it sink in. Instead, you''re just sitting there for a couple of minutes waiting for the characters on screen to come to terms with it.

Now to the script. The script was terrible. The expository dialogue was really bad, as mentioned above, and there were just so many cheesy lines in it. All the idealistic things that were being spouted out just made me roll my eyes, with all the "we''re pioneers, humanity was born here, but we weren''t meant to die here" crap. And of course love transcends time and space and everything. Anne Hathaway knows that one planet is better than the other because of ~love~. The whole reason Cooper can contact Murph and all that is because of ~love~. Love conquers all, man.

For some more minor things, using Morse code to be able to communicate data related to astrophysics and then magically using this to "solve" gravity is just dumb. Messing with time didn''t always work out like somebody casually waiting for 23 years and then acting like it''s nothing when they see humans for the first time again, or how Jason Bourne can sprint back to the station in five minutes when it clearly took at least an hour to walk from. A lot of the things with planets wouldn''t really work: all the waves stuff, how shallow the water is and their drop, solid ice clouds, the fact that they can escape from a planet with 130% gravity just in their spaceship, but whatever, I''ve tried to avoid criticising the science because it''s not really a big deal and even though it''s sort of set up as being a realistic film, it''s still just a movie. Besides, the science is mostly theoretical and speculation anyway so who knows, they might not be wrong about anything at all (they are). How come nobody cares what Cooper got up to in the 100 years he was gone? Also that''s not what Murphy''s law is.

Of course, it does a lot right, in particular the visual effects were really good and the score was absolutely outstanding, it definitely added a lot to the atmosphere, as did the use of silence. The docking, the way the takeoff was handled, entering the wormhole and some other scenes were really well-done too. TARS was great.

Now, despite having written all that, I''d still recommend watching it, especially in a cinema. I can definitely admire the film''s scope and I''m really glad that somebody''s able to attempt something like this while still having it be considered mainstream cinema. However, the people who are saying it''s one of the best films of all time are absolutely kidding themselves; I''m yet to see Insomnia, but otherwise Interstellar is Nolan''s second worst film, ahead of only TDKR. Of course, the fact that I''ve written so much about it obviously means I care and it certainly was thought-provoking and visually splendid, so even if I had a lot of issues with it, you should watch it if you haven''t already and who knows, maybe you''ll love it. At the very least, it''s definitely Nolan''s most ambitious film to date.', '2014-12-04 14:36:54.000000000', 'NEGATIVE', 1, 'https://trakt.tv/comments/18765', 'SUBJECTIVE', 0.9999900865943566, true, 'Interstellar was alright . To start with , the opening was very clunky . Obviously some exposition was necessary but it wasn '' t done naturally at all . Here , meet Cooper , just your average , every day engineer-scientist-quantum-physicist-drone-programmer-explorer-pioneer-farmer-pilot . Avoiding information dumps isn '' t really either Nolan '' s strong suit and while later on , especially on the space ship , expository dialogue is definitely necessary considering the subject matter , it still comes across as awkward . Cooper is occasionally an expert on things that should be beyond him ( which , of course , he conveniently explains for you ) , while at other times he '' s completely clueless about things that he should really know about in his position ( which , of course , somebody else conveniently explains for you ) . Cooper isn '' t the only one guilty of this though , everybody else on the spaceship likewise seem very ill-prepared for such a trip . Speaking of characters who aren '' t Cooper , everybody else '' s characterisation is terrible . You don '' t know anything at all about two members of the crew , and somehow you '' re meant to care about one of their completely avoidable deaths ( come on , he got to the ship first , he could have easily gotten in without getting in the way of TARS) ? Somehow you '' re also meant to care about My Cocaine '' s death ( which I '' ll get to in a moment ) because he '' s a father of somebody ? They '' re not even shown to have a close relationship or anything , it seemed more just an excuse to make a big reveal ( which I '' ll also get to in a moment ) . His daughter , Anne Hathaway '' s character , also doesn '' t seem to have much of a personality until it turns out that hey , she '' s actually in love with this person you '' ve never met . Even this " aspect " of her otherwise bland character seems to just have been added in as a lazy way to flesh her out and add unnecessary conflict . On the subject of unnecessary conflict , both the children , Murph and Tom , make really irrational decisions . When Murph tells Tom that he should move to save his family , he gets really upset because ... who knows ? And then even though he '' s given up hope on his dad , it '' s magically all okay later on when , after burning his crops , Murph tells him some nonsense about " hey , it was him all along , it was him , our father * sob * " . Prior to that of course , Murph '' s been holding a grudge against Cooper for like three decades , even though she knew for a large chunk of that what he was up to , after she began work at NASA . This relationship gets all sorted out when she has her magical realisation that the ghost was Cooper all along even though that '' s just a huge leap of faith and there '' s nothing to indicate that might be the case , unless , of course , it was ~love~ ( which , yes , I '' ll get to in a moment too ) . Back to the death bed scene . It had terrible sound mixing as you struggled to understand what My Cocaine was saying at all , but even worse it lacked any emotional significance as mentioned above , instead serving to make the reveal that he never wanted to go with Plan A all along . Of course , like all final words , it also ends with a very convenient moment where , instead of letting Murph know that her father didn '' t know anything about this , he decides to recite a poem because you gotta have that pointless ambiguity and conflict . This big reveal about it ends up removing any tension that might have happened when you get told the same twist later by Matt Damon ; there '' s no emotional impact as you were just told that ten minutes ago and you '' ve had that whole time to let it sink in . Instead , you '' re just sitting there for a couple of minutes waiting for the characters on screen to come to terms with it . Now to the script . The script was terrible . The expository dialogue was really bad , as mentioned above , and there were just so many cheesy lines in it . All the idealistic things that were being spouted out just made me roll my eyes , with all the " we '' re pioneers , humanity was born here , but we weren '' t meant to die here " crap . And of course love transcends time and space and everything . Anne Hathaway knows that one planet is better than the other because of ~love~ . The whole reason Cooper can contact Murph and all that is because of ~love~ . Love conquers all , man . For some more minor things , using Morse code to be able to communicate data related to astrophysics and then magically using this to " solve " gravity is just dumb . Messing with time didn '' t always work out like somebody casually waiting for 23 years and then acting like it '' s nothing when they see humans for the first time again , or how Jason Bourne can sprint back to the station in five minutes when it clearly took at least an hour to walk from . A lot of the things with planets wouldn '' t really work : all the waves stuff , how shallow the water is and their drop , solid ice clouds , the fact that they can escape from a planet with 130% gravity just in their spaceship , but whatever , I '' ve tried to avoid criticising the science because it '' s not really a big deal and even though it '' s sort of set up as being a realistic film , it '' s still just a movie . Besides , the science is mostly theoretical and speculation anyway so who knows , they might not be wrong about anything at all ( they are ) . How come nobody cares what Cooper got up to in the 100 years he was gone ? Also that '' s not what Murphy '' s law is . Of course , it does a lot right , in particular the visual effects were really good and the score was absolutely outstanding , it definitely added a lot to the atmosphere , as did the use of silence . The docking , the way the takeoff was handled , entering the wormhole and some other scenes were really well-done too . TARS was great . Now , despite having written all that , I '' d still recommend watching it , especially in a cinema .

Needless to say I did not really like this movie. The story is not very good, the science is ludicrous and the visuals not all that impressive. Maybe the latter would be better in a big theater (I watched this on my home cinema system which has a relatively large screen by European standards) but I am not really sure about that either.

Be warned that the rest of this review might contain a spoiler or two.

The movie starts of with the usual “I told you so” wet dream of the green fanatics on a dying Earth so it is off to a depressing start right away. That is an overused concept today as far as I am concerned. Then they pour it on with a school official claiming that he Apollo missions and moon landings never happened. What the f…? If they wanted to depress the audience right from the start they succeeded, at least with this audience.

The story proceeds with our heroes finding these gravity waves in the sand and by a huge stretch of imagination decrypts them to mean coordinates which leads them to the secret NASA base. Once there Cooper is told that he is their best choice of pilot for a “save the human race” mission through a wormhole. Yeah, right! This guy was former NASA. His whereabouts could hardly been unknown to them. If he was their best choice why would they entrust a mission to save the human race to someone else until he stumbled onto their door? Typical Hollywood nonsense!

The movie is full of this kind of rubbish. Romilly wastes 23 years of his life doing pretty much nothing except deciding not to go into the sleep capsule. The supposedly highly trained and vetted professor that they do find turns out to be a psychopath as well as and idiot almost blowing up the ship when trying to proceed with a docking that all the systems tells him have not succeeded. Then they proceed to dock with the main ship and stop its spin as well as bring it out of orbit around a planet with the shuttles engines. That is one hell of a powerful shuttle not to mention the strength of the docking mechanism! This just goes on. When someone is not doing something illogical or stupid (or both) they sit around talking, philosophizing and dragging the movie forward at snails pace. 169 minutes is way too much for this movie.

The movie ends up in one big time travel mess (okay they do not travel in time, just sends messages through time but still…) during a bunch of psychedelic scenes while traveling through the back hole. Science? Not so much. And what about this totally ludicrous massively illogical and inefficient robot design?

The one good thing I can say about this movie is that the performance of most of the actors, especially Matthew McConaughey, are quite good.

If the only factor in this review was what I saw visually, then I would give this a 10/10. With Christopher Nolan he has such healthy blend of practical and computer generated effects that it''s often hard to tell which is which. Part of what I love about him is that whenever he has the opportunity to use a practical effect over a computer generated one he''ll take it. And when he executes a practical effect he does not skimp out.There''s a scene in which the truck goes off the dirt path and runs through a cornfield. If the same script was handed to a different director it''s difficult to imagine that it would have been done with as much effort. With Christopher Nolan you could see the path being created by the vehicle in many overhead shots. And because it''s a practical effect you have a limited amount of opportunities to get the shot just right. Many directors would show the truck going in to the cornfield but then limit the shot to only being within the vehicle from that point on. I''m happy to say that Christopher Nolan puts effort into the shots that he''s filming instead of taking the easy route.

I really loved the movie visually and I thought the concept was pretty cool, but, alas, there are other aspects that make up a movie for me and some of these aspects were not done as well. Most of the performances were pretty great, but unfortunately the child actor playing Murph had a few slip-ups. Yes, she was able to cry from her tear ducts, but her performance was not really convincing. During what should be crucial and emotional scenes, her emphasis and enunciation was so off that I wasn''t really able to get into them. Matthew McConaughey''s performance held up nicely, so those scenes weren''t completely lost, but it was distracting to have one performance stick out like that when everyone else was doing so well.

The score by Hans Zimmer was pretty great as usual. It''s not his best score and it did get used pretty repetitively, but it was pretty great overall. I really liked the robots in the movie. Now, I''m aware that the design of these robots is so incredibly impractical that it would never happen in real life, but it was cool to watch them perform different tasks and use their bodies in sort of a Swiss army knife way. Their characters were very humourous and added a lot to my enjoyment of the film. And I''m a little forgiving when it comes to the impracticality of the design because it is clearly an homage to the monolith from 2001: A Space Odyssey.

The biggest problem I have with this movie has to do with the script. I can''t think of a single other Christopher Nolan film that had so many moments that I would call ''sappy''. In many ways it seemed as though this story wasn''t all that original. It was clearly inspired from films like "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "Sunshine",and I''m not sure I would call it better than either of those films. it is quite the pet peeve of mine when love is used to save the day.And in a Christopher Nolan movie I kind of expected better than that. So when Anne Hathaway''s character started speaking in a way that seemed as though it was setting up some sort of future reincorporation saying:"Oh, love transcends all dimensions!" I was seriously hoping her character was just crazy, despite the tone of the movie explicitly implying that it would be reincorporated seriously later.Unfortunately, I was right and it was reincorporated later seriously.When you''re going to reincorporate something it''s best if you can''t call out which scenes are going to be reincorporated before it happens.Like, seriously, as soon as Anne Hathaway started talking about it, all I could think was: "Oh God, please no." Yeah, love is totally not a chemical reaction in our bloodstream that exists to coerce reproduction. Love is magical and it transcends space and time! And the worst part about them not only including but reincorporating that line about love transcending dimensions,is that the movie could have been the exact same without that ever being mentioned and the logic would not have been changed at all. I don''t see how the film''s logic would have made any more or less sense if they didn''t mention that. Like, when Matthew McConaughey was fucking around with the past,he was attached to a specific room and not a person.Like, if she didn''t go back to that room as an adult then they would have been fucked. Like, if love for your children was the determining factor in this space equation, then shouldn''t you have been attached to her and not a room? I got the impression that the outcome of that scene depended on specific coordinates, so I really don''t see how love transcending dimensions had any effect on anything that happened.

Also, did no one find it weird how she immediately jumped to the conclusion "Oh, you''re my ghost"? Like, is there any person, especially a scientist, that would ever come up with that conclusion? Like, of course nobody believed you!There were no logical steps that would be taken to come up with that conclusion. I just love it when characters pull things out of their asses that happened to be 100% fact and ultimately decide the outcome of the film.It never feels cheap at all no matter how many times it happens.

Anyway, I enjoyed the movie overall and I found it to be worth the price of admission. If you find yourself heavily weighting a film''s visual aestethic into your overall rating, then go see this film and I''d imagine you''ll really love it. The small issues I had with the plot aren''t bound to affect everyone, so go see the film and judge it for yourself. Conceptually, I really loved what this movie did with time, and it made for some really emotional scenes.

At first glance, Interstellar looks like a space epic: a quest of galactic discovery and exploration. On the other hand, which you might have realized after less than an hour, it also feels like a family drama. Interstellar might be both though, which seems to explain why it has difficulties on building up the make believe the venture to space exploration.

Crop failures, disasters, and pestilence were the reasons why humans in Interstellar opted to do space travel. We can see this through the the situation presented in Joseph Cooper''s (Matt McCounaghy) family. However, rather than setting up the build up for a necessity on space exploration - mankind''s desperate attempt to save humanity by traveling to unknown regions - we get lots of family drama instead. Which, if done artfully, should be good.

But it didn''t.

The transition between Cooper''s family drama to the quest of space venture went a bit abrupt and janky - which seems to continue on even after Cooper jumped to other galaxy. In space, we get another drama between characters in the team. However, rather than making the dangerous space mission feels like a mission where a group of humans go at all cost to save mankind, it feels like amateur hobbyists delving to deep to the unknown.

First, most of the crews never experienced actually space flight, save for Cooper - which is why he was selected to go there. This is justified in the movie as resources have been scarce for several years, which actually would make this space quest even more desperate and urgent, but the movie fails to portray that urgency.

Which brings us to second point: characters behave stupidly for reasons very incomprehensible considering what''s at stake. One stupidity: a character died because the person just stands there doing nothing while impact is incoming. Another: when the crew decides which planet should be more potential to explore, they seem to forget what''s they''re risking and opting to think with emotional instinct. Someone thinks a planet is better because their loved one went there. Another thinks abandoning mission is more critical than guaranteeing humanity survival. This can be actually be done artfully if we can see the emotional dilemma, the depth of character''s thought - but nope. One person even childishly shut themselves in after the debate, what a professional.

Between the tedious crew drama and back-and-forth Cooper''s family drama on Earth, we sometimes still get the epic space exploration feel. Brilliant planets, beautiful unknown landscapes, the quest of going into something unknown, and discovering unexpected surprises. We get to scenes portraying the risk of space travel and difficult decisions they must make on solving that. There are beautiful moments, accompanied by Hans Zimmer''s titular composition - a few touching moment between characters and just the feeling of unknown curiosity that brings that marvels the galactic wonder. The ending - albeit feels a bit rushed for the built up when Cooper''s daughter realized the truth - is especially excellent, serving as a closure after the journey the characters went.

But it is mixed up with shallow character''s writing, awkward plot decisions, and sometimes the too-much-is-going-on directing/cutting (especially the back and forth scenes), so that Interstellar leaves me with a familiar yet uncomfortable feeling.

Christopher Nolan once said that 2001: A Space Odyssey was his all time favorite film and how he wanted to do a small tribute to he''s next film.

I saw this movie in IMAX and all through out this film I felt like I was in space floating around with Mconaughey and Anne Hathaway. I had that feeling that I was going deep into space just like are main character''s, going deep into space just like the viewing auditions and me.

The visual effect''s in this movie are some of the most stunning, beautiful and Jaw dropping effect''s I''ve seen since 2001: A Space Odyssey.

Now most people or critics have said that last third of this movie ruined the movie for them, but I actually like the ending to the movie. It''s new for Nolan because he always ends on a deep and cold note, but this movie didn''t and I didn''t mind it.

Casting Matt Damon was probably too much. I also didn’t like the robot. It didn’t feel realistic at all. Nolan trying to have something different went too far. No way I can accept that a big ridiculous wall is a reasonable shape for an intelligent walking robot. It screams look how clever we are.

Also it was a bad idea to cast Ellen Burstyn as old Murph. That’s the most important emotional moment of the movie and immediately you feel it’s someone else, it’s not Murph.

Great acting, interesting screenplay, great graphics, lots of hardcore science done "right", great emotions.

Plot: (minor spoilers)
Earth is dying. Humans are trying to survive, but crops fail them and they face extinction. Their only chance of survival is finding new planet that is habitable. This is possible due to warmhole located near Saturn. Scouts have been sent in past to explore several options, but due to communication fault one more mission needs to be sent to confirm the right planet.

Story: (medium spoilers)
Copper (Matthew McConaughey; story protagonist) is a father, ex NASA pilot, living with his family as farmers, trying to survive by producing last grow-able food corn. He cares deeply for his children, but upon discovering NASA hidden station he faces decision to go to space, to find/confirm new planet human race could live on.

What the protagonist wants in the movie from the start is to get back. This is for me interesting screenplay. Cooper decision to go to space was almost given to him. He know that was what he needed to do, what he was born and trained to do. Saving human race for me is the background of the story. He promises to his daughter (Murphy) that he will return to see her.

She is his relationship character. She wants him to stay with them, not to go. Something that the protagonists fails to see in fullest, he know he wants it, but puts it aside for greater good, the mission. This part is important for the emotional side of story and is very strong!

As for antagonist: this is the universe, and the physical laws. Mainly time relativity. The movie nicely depicts the realities of any possible space travel and its implication to our exposure to time. This is the main obstacle to the antagonist to reconcile with his goal, to go back, to see his daughter, because she would die of old age before he would return back. So he is racing against the time, will he make it?

My summary and opinion:
Really great movie mainly due to screenplay that is well executed by actors and cinematics. Main strength i see in the "hidden" true story, that coincides with the fore-front story of saving human race. The resolution of the movie is well timed to coincide in three elements getting reconciled (The antagonist goal, the saving of human race, and emotional reconciliation with the relationship character (daughter) )

In "Interstellar", a film written and directed by Christopher Nolan,
climate change has decimated most of the world''s food supplies.
Towns are regularly ravaged by fierce sand storms, and
everything is covered with thick layers of dust.

A very select group of scientists set out to embark
on humanities most ambitious mission: travel through
a newly discovered wormhole into another galaxy.
They hope of collecting the necessary data to either move
many people onto a new experimental gravitation spaceship, or find a new Earth altogether.

I have now watched this movie twice at an IMAX.
After my first viewing, when the credits rolled,
I sat there perplexed and was unable to move. I was paralysed
by what I had seen. I looked around, I was not the only one.
Unquestionably, one of the greatest movies I had ever seen.
I was almost ashamed to admit it, because it felt like I had no
say in this decision whatsoever.
There are many moments when "Interstellar" transcends into
something so artistic, you are left speechless and are moved to tears.

The cinematography and directing is, even by Nolan''s standards,
his best work so far. I think his talent is even too profound for
the Academy of Motion Pictures, hence why he has yet to receive an oscar
for directing. Personally, after watching "Interstellar", I consider
him to be the best director that is currently alive, only rivalled
by Kubrick and Hitchcock.

Hans Zimmer wrote the score and I really recommend to read how
he translated Nolan''s fantastic ideas into music.
I get goosebumps just thinking about the high-speed docking scene,
and you will, too! The sound engineers did an amazing job contrasting
the cosmic silence with Zimmer''s incredibly ethereal music.
During the rocket launch, the entire theatre shook and you were
really feeling the thrust.

If I was forced to describe the score, I would say it was
heavily influenced by Johann Strauß, Philip Glass and Bach.
Truly a masterpiece that deserves to be revisited many times and
among all the great soundtracks he has ever done, this is simply
on an entirely different level. His most intimate work.

The visual effects were breathtaking - quite literally.
The on-screen silence during certain parts of the movie
was only rivalled by the complete and utter silence
of my fellow IMAX watchers. Nobody said a word, nobody moved.
Just hundreds of mesmerized people staring at the screen,
or digging their fingers into their armrests during
some of the most tense moments I have ever seen.

"Interstellar" depicts astrophysical concepts that
have never been seen or discussed on-screen before.
"Awesome", in its most literal sense, really describes it.

When I set out to write this review, I really tried to
avoid superlatives, and give you a more nuanced opinion
of why I think this movie deserves to be ranked among
the best, but I now see how I have failed.

I recommend to watch "Interstellar" at an IMAX,
or the best movie theatre around you.
It''s not something you should rent at a Red Box or watch on Netflix.

To start with, the opening was very clunky. Obviously some exposition was necessary but it wasn''t done naturally at all. Here, meet Cooper, just your average, every day engineer-scientist-quantum-physicist-drone-programmer-explorer-pioneer-farmer-pilot. Avoiding information dumps isn''t really either Nolan''s strong suit and while later on, especially on the space ship, expository dialogue is definitely necessary considering the subject matter, it still comes across as awkward. Cooper is occasionally an expert on things that should be beyond him (which, of course, he conveniently explains for you), while at other times he''s completely clueless about things that he should really know about in his position (which, of course, somebody else conveniently explains for you). Cooper isn''t the only one guilty of this though, everybody else on the spaceship likewise seem very ill-prepared for such a trip.

Speaking of characters who aren''t Cooper, everybody else''s characterisation is terrible. You don''t know anything at all about two members of the crew, and somehow you''re meant to care about one of their completely avoidable deaths (come on, he got to the ship first, he could have easily gotten in without getting in the way of TARS)? Somehow you''re also meant to care about My Cocaine''s death (which I''ll get to in a moment) because he''s a father of somebody? They''re not even shown to have a close relationship or anything, it seemed more just an excuse to make a big reveal (which I''ll also get to in a moment). His daughter, Anne Hathaway''s character, also doesn''t seem to have much of a personality until it turns out that hey, she''s actually in love with this person you''ve never met. Even this "aspect" of her otherwise bland character seems to just have been added in as a lazy way to flesh her out and add unnecessary conflict. On the subject of unnecessary conflict, both the children, Murph and Tom, make really irrational decisions. When Murph tells Tom that he should move to save his family, he gets really upset because... who knows? And then even though he''s given up hope on his dad, it''s magically all okay later on when, after burning his crops, Murph tells him some nonsense about "hey, it was him all along, it was him, our father *sob*". Prior to that of course, Murph''s been holding a grudge against Cooper for like three decades, even though she knew for a large chunk of that what he was up to, after she began work at NASA. This relationship gets all sorted out when she has her magical realisation that the ghost was Cooper all along even though that''s just a huge leap of faith and there''s nothing to indicate that might be the case, unless, of course, it was ~love~ (which, yes, I''ll get to in a moment too).

Back to the death bed scene. It had terrible sound mixing as you struggled to understand what My Cocaine was saying at all, but even worse it lacked any emotional significance as mentioned above, instead serving to make the reveal that he never wanted to go with Plan A all along. Of course, like all final words, it also ends with a very convenient moment where, instead of letting Murph know that her father didn''t know anything about this, he decides to recite a poem because you gotta have that pointless ambiguity and conflict. This big reveal about it ends up removing any tension that might have happened when you get told the same twist later by Matt Damon; there''s no emotional impact as you were just told that ten minutes ago and you''ve had that whole time to let it sink in. Instead, you''re just sitting there for a couple of minutes waiting for the characters on screen to come to terms with it.

Now to the script. The script was terrible. The expository dialogue was really bad, as mentioned above, and there were just so many cheesy lines in it. All the idealistic things that were being spouted out just made me roll my eyes, with all the "we''re pioneers, humanity was born here, but we weren''t meant to die here" crap. And of course love transcends time and space and everything. Anne Hathaway knows that one planet is better than the other because of ~love~. The whole reason Cooper can contact Murph and all that is because of ~love~. Love conquers all, man.

For some more minor things, using Morse code to be able to communicate data related to astrophysics and then magically using this to "solve" gravity is just dumb. Messing with time didn''t always work out like somebody casually waiting for 23 years and then acting like it''s nothing when they see humans for the first time again, or how Jason Bourne can sprint back to the station in five minutes when it clearly took at least an hour to walk from. A lot of the things with planets wouldn''t really work: all the waves stuff, how shallow the water is and their drop, solid ice clouds, the fact that they can escape from a planet with 130% gravity just in their spaceship, but whatever, I''ve tried to avoid criticising the science because it''s not really a big deal and even though it''s sort of set up as being a realistic film, it''s still just a movie. Besides, the science is mostly theoretical and speculation anyway so who knows, they might not be wrong about anything at all (they are). How come nobody cares what Cooper got up to in the 100 years he was gone? Also that''s not what Murphy''s law is.

Of course, it does a lot right, in particular the visual effects were really good and the score was absolutely outstanding, it definitely added a lot to the atmosphere, as did the use of silence. The docking, the way the takeoff was handled, entering the wormhole and some other scenes were really well-done too. TARS was great.

Now, despite having written all that, I''d still recommend watching it, especially in a cinema. I can definitely admire the film''s scope and I''m really glad that somebody''s able to attempt something like this while still having it be considered mainstream cinema. However, the people who are saying it''s one of the best films of all time are absolutely kidding themselves; I''m yet to see Insomnia, but otherwise Interstellar is Nolan''s second worst film, ahead of only TDKR. Of course, the fact that I''ve written so much about it obviously means I care and it certainly was thought-provoking and visually splendid, so even if I had a lot of issues with it, you should watch it if you haven''t already and who knows, maybe you''ll love it.

To start with , the opening was very clunky . Obviously some exposition was necessary but it wasn '' t done naturally at all . Here , meet Cooper , just your average , every day engineer-scientist-quantum-physicist-drone-programmer-explorer-pioneer-farmer-pilot . Avoiding information dumps isn '' t really either Nolan '' s strong suit and while later on , especially on the space ship , expository dialogue is definitely necessary considering the subject matter , it still comes across as awkward . Cooper is occasionally an expert on things that should be beyond him ( which , of course , he conveniently explains for you ) , while at other times he '' s completely clueless about things that he should really know about in his position ( which , of course , somebody else conveniently explains for you ) . Cooper isn '' t the only one guilty of this though , everybody else on the spaceship likewise seem very ill-prepared for such a trip . Speaking of characters who aren '' t Cooper , everybody else '' s characterisation is terrible . You don '' t know anything at all about two members of the crew , and somehow you '' re meant to care about one of their completely avoidable deaths ( come on , he got to the ship first , he could have easily gotten in without getting in the way of TARS) ? Somehow you '' re also meant to care about My Cocaine '' s death ( which I '' ll get to in a moment ) because he '' s a father of somebody ? They '' re not even shown to have a close relationship or anything , it seemed more just an excuse to make a big reveal ( which I '' ll also get to in a moment ) . His daughter , Anne Hathaway '' s character , also doesn '' t seem to have much of a personality until it turns out that hey , she '' s actually in love with this person you '' ve never met . Even this " aspect " of her otherwise bland character seems to just have been added in as a lazy way to flesh her out and add unnecessary conflict . On the subject of unnecessary conflict , both the children , Murph and Tom , make really irrational decisions . When Murph tells Tom that he should move to save his family , he gets really upset because ... who knows ? And then even though he '' s given up hope on his dad , it '' s magically all okay later on when , after burning his crops , Murph tells him some nonsense about " hey , it was him all along , it was him , our father * sob * " .

Needless to say I did not really like this movie. The story is not very good, the science is ludicrous and the visuals not all that impressive. Maybe the latter would be better in a big theater (I watched this on my home cinema system which has a relatively large screen by European standards) but I am not really sure about that either.

Be warned that the rest of this review might contain a spoiler or two.

The movie starts of with the usual “I told you so” wet dream of the green fanatics on a dying Earth so it is off to a depressing start right away. That is an overused concept today as far as I am concerned. Then they pour it on with a school official claiming that he Apollo missions and moon landings never happened. What the f…? If they wanted to depress the audience right from the start they succeeded, at least with this audience.

The story proceeds with our heroes finding these gravity waves in the sand and by a huge stretch of imagination decrypts them to mean coordinates which leads them to the secret NASA base. Once there Cooper is told that he is their best choice of pilot for a “save the human race” mission through a wormhole. Yeah, right! This guy was former NASA. His whereabouts could hardly been unknown to them. If he was their best choice why would they entrust a mission to save the human race to someone else until he stumbled onto their door? Typical Hollywood nonsense!

The movie is full of this kind of rubbish. Romilly wastes 23 years of his life doing pretty much nothing except deciding not to go into the sleep capsule. The supposedly highly trained and vetted professor that they do find turns out to be a psychopath as well as and idiot almost blowing up the ship when trying to proceed with a docking that all the systems tells him have not succeeded. Then they proceed to dock with the main ship and stop its spin as well as bring it out of orbit around a planet with the shuttles engines. That is one hell of a powerful shuttle not to mention the strength of the docking mechanism! This just goes on. When someone is not doing something illogical or stupid (or both) they sit around talking, philosophizing and dragging the movie forward at snails pace. 169 minutes is way too much for this movie.

The movie ends up in one big time travel mess (okay they do not travel in time, just sends messages through time but still…) during a bunch of psychedelic scenes while traveling through the back hole. Science? Not so much. And what about this totally ludicrous massively illogical and inefficient robot design?

If the only factor in this review was what I saw visually, then I would give this a 10/10. With Christopher Nolan he has such healthy blend of practical and computer generated effects that it''s often hard to tell which is which. Part of what I love about him is that whenever he has the opportunity to use a practical effect over a computer generated one he''ll take it. And when he executes a practical effect he does not skimp out.There''s a scene in which the truck goes off the dirt path and runs through a cornfield. If the same script was handed to a different director it''s difficult to imagine that it would have been done with as much effort. With Christopher Nolan you could see the path being created by the vehicle in many overhead shots. And because it''s a practical effect you have a limited amount of opportunities to get the shot just right. Many directors would show the truck going in to the cornfield but then limit the shot to only being within the vehicle from that point on. I''m happy to say that Christopher Nolan puts effort into the shots that he''s filming instead of taking the easy route.

I really loved the movie visually and I thought the concept was pretty cool, but, alas, there are other aspects that make up a movie for me and some of these aspects were not done as well. Most of the performances were pretty great, but unfortunately the child actor playing Murph had a few slip-ups. Yes, she was able to cry from her tear ducts, but her performance was not really convincing. During what should be crucial and emotional scenes, her emphasis and enunciation was so off that I wasn''t really able to get into them. Matthew McConaughey''s performance held up nicely, so those scenes weren''t completely lost, but it was distracting to have one performance stick out like that when everyone else was doing so well.

The score by Hans Zimmer was pretty great as usual. It''s not his best score and it did get used pretty repetitively, but it was pretty great overall. I really liked the robots in the movie. Now, I''m aware that the design of these robots is so incredibly impractical that it would never happen in real life, but it was cool to watch them perform different tasks and use their bodies in sort of a Swiss army knife way. Their characters were very humourous and added a lot to my enjoyment of the film. And I''m a little forgiving when it comes to the impracticality of the design because it is clearly an homage to the monolith from 2001: A Space Odyssey.

The biggest problem I have with this movie has to do with the script. I can''t think of a single other Christopher Nolan film that had so many moments that I would call ''sappy''. In many ways it seemed as though this story wasn''t all that original. It was clearly inspired from films like "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "Sunshine",and I''m not sure I would call it better than either of those films. it is quite the pet peeve of mine when love is used to save the day.And in a Christopher Nolan movie I kind of expected better than that. So when Anne Hathaway''s character started speaking in a way that seemed as though it was setting up some sort of future reincorporation saying:"Oh, love transcends all dimensions!" I was seriously hoping her character was just crazy, despite the tone of the movie explicitly implying that it would be reincorporated seriously later.Unfortunately, I was right and it was reincorporated later seriously.When you''re going to reincorporate something it''s best if you can''t call out which scenes are going to be reincorporated before it happens.Like, seriously, as soon as Anne Hathaway started talking about it, all I could think was: "Oh God, please no." Yeah, love is totally not a chemical reaction in our bloodstream that exists to coerce reproduction. Love is magical and it transcends space and time! And the worst part about them not only including but reincorporating that line about love transcending dimensions,is that the movie could have been the exact same without that ever being mentioned and the logic would not have been changed at all. I don''t see how the film''s logic would have made any more or less sense if they didn''t mention that. Like, when Matthew McConaughey was fucking around with the past,he was attached to a specific room and not a person.Like, if she didn''t go back to that room as an adult then they would have been fucked. Like, if love for your children was the determining factor in this space equation, then shouldn''t you have been attached to her and not a room? I got the impression that the outcome of that scene depended on specific coordinates, so I really don''t see how love transcending dimensions had any effect on anything that happened.

Also, did no one find it weird how she immediately jumped to the conclusion "Oh, you''re my ghost"? Like, is there any person, especially a scientist, that would ever come up with that conclusion? Like, of course nobody believed you!There were no logical steps that would be taken to come up with that conclusion. I just love it when characters pull things out of their asses that happened to be 100% fact and ultimately decide the outcome of the film.It never feels cheap at all no matter how many times it happens.

Anyway, I enjoyed the movie overall and I found it to be worth the price of admission. If you find yourself heavily weighting a film''s visual aestethic into your overall rating, then go see this film and I''d imagine you''ll really love it. The small issues I had with the plot aren''t bound to affect everyone, so go see the film and judge it for yourself. Conceptually, I really loved what this movie did with time, and it made for some really emotional scenes. Even though I thought this movie was visually fantastic, overall it didn''t wow me in the way that I hoped it would.

At first glance, Interstellar looks like a space epic: a quest of galactic discovery and exploration. On the other hand, which you might have realized after less than an hour, it also feels like a family drama. Interstellar might be both though, which seems to explain why it has difficulties on building up the make believe the venture to space exploration.

Crop failures, disasters, and pestilence were the reasons why humans in Interstellar opted to do space travel. We can see this through the the situation presented in Joseph Cooper''s (Matt McCounaghy) family. However, rather than setting up the build up for a necessity on space exploration - mankind''s desperate attempt to save humanity by traveling to unknown regions - we get lots of family drama instead. Which, if done artfully, should be good.

But it didn''t.

The transition between Cooper''s family drama to the quest of space venture went a bit abrupt and janky - which seems to continue on even after Cooper jumped to other galaxy. In space, we get another drama between characters in the team. However, rather than making the dangerous space mission feels like a mission where a group of humans go at all cost to save mankind, it feels like amateur hobbyists delving to deep to the unknown.

First, most of the crews never experienced actually space flight, save for Cooper - which is why he was selected to go there. This is justified in the movie as resources have been scarce for several years, which actually would make this space quest even more desperate and urgent, but the movie fails to portray that urgency.

Which brings us to second point: characters behave stupidly for reasons very incomprehensible considering what''s at stake. One stupidity: a character died because the person just stands there doing nothing while impact is incoming. Another: when the crew decides which planet should be more potential to explore, they seem to forget what''s they''re risking and opting to think with emotional instinct. Someone thinks a planet is better because their loved one went there. Another thinks abandoning mission is more critical than guaranteeing humanity survival. This can be actually be done artfully if we can see the emotional dilemma, the depth of character''s thought - but nope. One person even childishly shut themselves in after the debate, what a professional.

Between the tedious crew drama and back-and-forth Cooper''s family drama on Earth, we sometimes still get the epic space exploration feel. Brilliant planets, beautiful unknown landscapes, the quest of going into something unknown, and discovering unexpected surprises. We get to scenes portraying the risk of space travel and difficult decisions they must make on solving that. There are beautiful moments, accompanied by Hans Zimmer''s titular composition - a few touching moment between characters and just the feeling of unknown curiosity that brings that marvels the galactic wonder. The ending - albeit feels a bit rushed for the built up when Cooper''s daughter realized the truth - is especially excellent, serving as a closure after the journey the characters went.

But it is mixed up with shallow character''s writing, awkward plot decisions, and sometimes the too-much-is-going-on directing/cutting (especially the back and forth scenes), so that Interstellar leaves me with a familiar yet uncomfortable feeling.

The story is about a team of explorers undertakes the most important mission in human history; traveling beyond this galaxy to discover whether mankind has a future among the stars.

Christopher Nolan once said that 2001: A Space Odyssey was his all time favorite film and how he wanted to do a small tribute to he''s next film. And then comes a movie called "Interstellar" that will put a smile on Kubrick face if he was alive today, because Interstellar is one of the best movie of 2014 and the best movie experience I''ve had at the cinema.

I saw this movie in IMAX and all through out this film I felt like I was in space floating around with Mconaughey and Anne Hathaway. I had that feeling that I was going deep into space just like are main character''s, going deep into space just like the viewing auditions and me.

The visual effect''s in this movie are some of the most stunning, beautiful and Jaw dropping effect''s I''ve seen since 2001: A Space Odyssey. The performances were brilliant, The cinematography was breathtaking and hard to look away. The directing by Christopher Nolan and let me get this out there, this man is a true director; he knows cinema and knows how to interested people into seeing he''s films and I''m still shocked that he hasn''t won an Oscar yet.

Now most people or critics have said that last third of this movie ruined the movie for them, but I actually like the ending to the movie. It''s new for Nolan because he always ends on a deep and cold note, but this movie didn''t and I didn''t mind it.

My only nick pick with the movie is some of the character''s in this movie wasn''t all that interesting. Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are the only character''s that to me were interesting and I cared for them, but the rest of the character''s I didn''t really care for.

For perhaps the first time in my life, I am completely speechless. I just got back from an early screening of the movie (we have early screenings in Poland! Who knew?). I''m going to try and collect my thoughts as I write, but I''m just buzzing with excitement, so I make no promises as to how this will turn out. I hope you''ll stick with me regardless.

After BvS and Suicide Squad were poorly received by critics (and audiences too, although here the opinions were more divided), a lot of people were afraid of how this movie would turn out. And I swear, no one was more scared than me. I didn''t grow up with Wonder Woman - hell, I wasn''t even aware of her existence until like two years ago, but I so desperately wanted her movie to succeed. A female superhero in the title role and a female director? That is huge. That''s something I''ve been waiting for since I was a kid. And I spent the last year kind of holding my breath, hoping with all my might that this movie would be good.

And it is. Thank the gods, it really is.

Oh, and before I forget: this review will be spoiler-free, I don''t intend to ruin any of the important plot points for anyone.

So, let''s get to it, shall we?

First of all, the plot. The plot is simple, linear, without unnecessary storylines shoehorned in there for no reason. That doesn''t make it any less engaging or exciting, of course. If anything, it allows you to really immerse yourself in the story. And boy, is the story great. There''s plenty of cliches there, but honestly, there is something to be said about cliches. If done correctly, they are amazing. And they definitely are done correctly here.

The movie looks gorgeous as well. There are actual colors there, along with some stunning shots. The editing is on point, everything flows pretty much flawlessly.

The music is sick. I mean, they managed to incorporate WW''s theme in there, with all of its electric cello glory. And it''s just... insane.

The action scenes will make you want to fist pump and yell "Hell yeah!". Whatever you''re imagining, I promise you, the movie will exceed your expectations. I still have goosebumps and it''s been like an hour since I left the theatre.

As for the acting, everyone does a wonderful (no pun intended) job. I want to talk about Gal Gadot for a second, because I feel like a lot of people had doubts as to whether or not she could handle such a huge role and such an iconic heroine. Worry not. She''s got this. It''s actually kind of jaw-dropping how much she''s got this. She pours everything she has into this performance. Her Diana is layered, a perfect balance of innocently naive and fiercely badass. She brings heart and humanity and a range of emotions to the character. She will make you laugh. She will make you cry. And most importantly, she will make you feel the sheer power and confidence that she radiates while still having moments of vulnerability. She''s glorious. She IS Wonder Woman.

Everyone loves Chris Pine, and he does a great job here as well. Steve Trevor keeps up with Diana without once trying to overshadow her and they make a fantastic duo. And he has his fair share of cool moments as well. Connie Nielsen and Robin Wright manage to do a lot with the few scenes they''re given. Lucy Davis is super funny. Overall, a pretty awesome cast of supporting actors.

And finally, what struck me the most about this movie was how heartfelt and genuine, and just... good it was. I mean, it''s a brilliant movie, but it''s also good in the sense that it inspires you and fills you with hope and optimism, which I think is something we rarely get in movies nowadays. It warms your heart and makes you feel so many different things. It hits all the right notes. There''s no shortage of dramatic, incredibly emotional moments that will bring tears to your eyes. But it''s also often hilarious and joyful - I laughed out loud more than once, and so did the rest of the room.. And when it wants to be epic, it is larger than life, powerful and spectacular.

I recognize and respect the fact that to many people, this movie won''t be perfect. But to me, it is. It''s everything I wanted it to be and then some. Hats off to Patty Jenkins, Gal Gadot and everyone else involved. They created something truly incredile. I''m seeing it again on Saturday. And quite possibly a few more times after that. If I blow all my money on tickets for this movie, it will be worth it. No regrets.

Now, time to go to bed and cry about how much I love Diana. I hope everyone has as unforgettable an experience with Wonder Woman as I did.

UPDATE: Having seen this movie 4 times in 2 weeks, I can safely say that it''s insanely rewatchable. Also, I''m an emotional mess who''s cried at least 3 times during each one of those 4 screenings.

For perhaps the first time in my life , I am completely speechless . I just got back from an early screening of the movie ( we have early screenings in Poland ! Who knew ? ) . I '' m going to try and collect my thoughts as I write , but I '' m just buzzing with excitement , so I make no promises as to how this will turn out . I hope you '' ll stick with me regardless . After BvS and Suicide Squad were poorly received by critics ( and audiences too , although here the opinions were more divided ) , a lot of people were afraid of how this movie would turn out . And I swear , no one was more scared than me . I didn '' t grow up with Wonder Woman - hell , I wasn '' t even aware of her existence until like two years ago , but I so desperately wanted her movie to succeed . A female superhero in the title role and a female director ? That is huge . That '' s something I '' ve been waiting for since I was a kid . And I spent the last year kind of holding my breath , hoping with all my might that this movie would be good . And it is . Thank the gods , it really is . Oh , and before I forget : this review will be spoiler-free , I don '' t intend to ruin any of the important plot points for anyone . So , let '' s get to it , shall we ? First of all , the plot . The plot is simple , linear , without unnecessary storylines shoehorned in there for no reason . That doesn '' t make it any less engaging or exciting , of course . If anything , it allows you to really immerse yourself in the story . And boy , is the story great . There '' s plenty of cliches there , but honestly , there is something to be said about cliches . If done correctly , they are amazing . And they definitely are done correctly here . The movie looks gorgeous as well . There are actual colors there , along with some stunning shots .

ALMOST.

Wonder Woman can be summarized as a great interrupted nerd coitus.
The starting was really enjoyable, everything was going smooth as butter. Movie was fun, was interesting, was hyping as fuck. Gal Gadot is phenomenal, Chris Pine made me gay (again), Elena Anaya converted me back to being hetero... but then... the inevitable happened.

Something I was expecting all along, something I expect every-single-time a movie about a DC character gets announced.

**SOMETHING - FUCKS - UP**
  (badly, very, very badly)

In other movies like... BVS or Suicide Squad, wait a minute... I admit it''s not entirely fair comparing it with those two, considering at least Wonder Woman was a bit enjoyable for the first 2.5/4 of it.

Anywho, in this case, what bothered me a lot - interrupted nerd coitus - was the ending.

The movie transformed from a breath of fresh air to the same overbuilt, overcheesed, oversped, overfucked, overterribilized™ piece of stinking shit that DC (Or whoever fucks their characters up) accustomed us to.

Why you ask? Well... it''s simple.

The major problem was in fact with the speed they clearly made the ending to be.

I can explain this with a simple equation:

[spoiler]Lover("I love you"+Suicide)+(Terrible cgi)=Angry Gal Gadot=God Wonder Woman=????????????????[/spoiler]

[spoiler]She kills Ares, but it wasn''t Ares (no shit) - then Ares appears (no shit) - then he''s way too powerful (no shit) - BANG! BIG SECRET REVEALED (no shit) - Gal Gadot is so confused she hit herself (no shit) - Big Jim does a Captain America and saves everyone (no shit) - Gal Gadot becomes god -- "INSERT HERE STUPID PHOTOGRAPHY, CGI, POINTLESS GLORIFYING WALKING SCENES" - Ares is dead (no shit).[/spoiler]

That said: I must say that I enojyed this movie more than... scratch that, this is the only DC character movie I enjoyed following the current DCCU (DC Cinematic Universe)[God Bless Christopher Nolan''s soul]. It truly had meaning and potential, but I guess they ran out of minutes.

Sad.

PS:

Gal Gadot is hot as fuck.

There''s a great mix of action, comedy and emotion with a twist or two so something for everyone.

Being straight up and honest but I had no anticipation for this film whatsoever. The trailers were cool and Gal Gadot looked perfect for the role from what I could tell, the problem was I never really cared for the character of Wonder Woman, admittedly I don''t really care for any superheroes unless your name is Batman. And with the DCEU track record being abysmal, Suicide Squad being one of the biggest disappointments since my birth, Batman V Superman just being utter shite and appreciating Man of Steel but if not really being my thing, it was easy for me to go into this film with the lowest expectations.
I can safely say this is the best ''superhero'' film I''ve seen since ''The Dark Knight Rises''. It''s not a perfect film and not even close to being on the level of the Dark Knight trilogy, it doesn''t need to be though because this is hopefully the first big step into making the DCEU into something...well, simply put, better.
First off, Gal Gadot, she owns the role of Wonder Woman and can honestly say nobody could''ve done a better job. She sold every aspect of the character to me, whether she''s killing Germans or having more of the heart felt moments with Chris Pine''s character, it all works incredibly well. You do have your basic 3 ark structure when it comes to these kinds of films, Origin, Action, 1V1. But it''s the moments in between all of this that makes the film special and better than the rest. I found some of the smaller moments between Diana and to feel natural and didn''t come off cheesy like it so easily could have, great chemistry together and really help flesh out her character even more when she''s thrown into his world and we see it through her eyes, in great comedic taste might I add.
The action scenes are also spectacular, some of the CG and green screen downs unfortunately stand out and become blatantly obvious at times, but I can almost forgive that just because of how well choreographed it all was.
My biggest flaw and sadly it seems to be like this whether it''s marvel or DC; villains (minus Heath Ledgers Joker don''t worry). Yet again we find another generic ''I want to kill people'' villain, just found the villain characters so bland and was there just to have a ''threat'' and a big fight at the end, got to have a big fight at the end of what''s the point right?
All in all, I found this to be a fun action film, but with some great heartfelt moments dotted through out, more than I thought there would be and that''s what made this film a little bit more special to the rest. Gal Gadot does an incredible job at playing Diana and if anything, at least we''ll have her in Justice League if all else fails in that film. Saying that however, I do hope all the trashy DC films are behind us and we can move onwards and upwards.

76 anni dopo la sua prima comparsa, Wonder Woman viene presentata sugli schermi delle sale cinematografiche con il volto di Gal Gadot, attrice e modella israeliana, conosciuta principalmente per il ruolo lei attribuito nella saga di "Fast and Furious". La trama ripercorre, grazie ad un flashback della protagonista, le origini del personaggio: principessa delle amazzoni, cresciuta su un''isola paradisiaca al riparo dal mondo esterno, fin da bambina la futura Wonder Woman è stata protetta dalle attenzioni di sua madre e del suo popolo. Il faticoso allenamento tradizionale per diventare una combattente invincibile le ha permesso di scoprire le sue doti nascoste, abilità innate fuori del comune persino su un''isola di grandi guerriere. Tuttavia, i poteri la investono di una responsabilità che sconfina dal suo piccolo regno e, con l''arrivo del pilota americano Steve Trevor, costretto a un atterraggio di emergenza sulle coste di Themyscira, Diana viene posta di fronte a una verità che non può ignorare: tra gli uomini imperversa infatti un atroce conflitto mondiale a cui lei vuole porre fine. Cresciuta con le storie della madre che le narrano di come Ares, il dio della Guerra, abbia corrotto gli uomini e di come fosse proprio responsabilità delle Amazzoni distruggere lui e tutto ciò che rappresenta, Diana è convinta di poter fermare la minaccia con le sue sole forze, così lascia la sua casa diretta verso il mondo degli uomini di cui ha sentito parlare soltanto nelle fiabe.
Realizzato in pellicola, nel tentativo di trovare un compromesso tra vintage e modernità, "Wonder Woman" si allontana nettamente dai precedenti "Batman v Superman" (2016) e "Suicide Suqad" (2016) guadagnandosi, per ora, il primo posto sul podio dei film che l''Universo Cinematografico DC ha prodotto. Tale merito, oltre alla regia, va in parte anche attribuito alla bravura di Gal Gadot che, indossatrice dal fisico slanciato, dall’eleganza naturale e capace di incarnare alla perfezione il ruolo che le viene attribuito, riesce a sorreggere sulle spalle una sceneggiatura non sempre lineare e priva di imperfezioni.
Dall''altro lato però Chris Pine, che qua riveste il ruolo di Steve Trevor, un ufficiale dell''intelligence dell''Esercito degli Stati Uniti, a volte risulta essere inespressivo, come occultato dall''ombra e dalla bravura che l''interpretazione della Gadot riesce a far emergere dal suo personaggio.

Discorso diverso riguarda invece più da vicino le sequenze di combattimento che, sebbene siano sorrette da coreografie eccellenti e da una colonna sonora incalzante precedentemente già ascoltata in "Batman v Superman", eccedono in ralenti e slow motion che mettono in risalto più lo stampo commerciale di Zack Snyder, produttore del film, che lo sguardo autoriale della regista Patty Jenkins. Pesano anche gli effetti speciali utilizzati per la battaglia finale in cui si alterna un villain digitale dalle fattezze già viste e uno scontro costituito sulla forza fisica piuttosto che sulla scaltrezza della protagonista.

This was very entertaining with great action and good chemistry between the two lead actors. The first half was surprisingly funny with the classic "an outsider comes to town and everything is different and weird." The second half is a little more dark with Wonder Woman fighting in the war. [spoiler]The scene when she comes out of the trenches was awesome, gave me goosebumps. The last fight was a little too CGI heavy and cheesy but still very fun. Sad to see Chris Pine sacrifice himself, would of loved to see him in future movies.

It’s true, but limiting its quality to those terms does a disservice not only to how the film stands on its own, but how it represents a notable achievement (and hopefully turning point) for the representation of women in superhero cinema. But even on its own merits, Wonder Woman succeeds when it breaks away from the conventions of the cinematic universe cemented by its Bat- and Super-brethren, and stumbles when it gets caught in the same muck that has hobbled the movies of Wonder Woman’s D.C. stablemates. The end result is this cinematic universe’s first legitimately good film, but one still weighed down by the cinematic baggage of its predecessors.

It’s notable then, that *Wonder Woman*’s closest analogue on the silver screen would seem to be an amalgamation of the first *Thor* movie and *Captain America: The First Avenger*. It captures the latter’s sense of throwback adventure, inserting a superpowered individual into a world war and fighting the supernatural threats with a ragtag team of allies. And it captures the former’s sense of a god come to Earth, with the same sort of mantle-relinquishing, fish out of water comedy, and romance between deity and man that drove Kenneth Branagh’s lone foray into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

To that end, *Wonder Woman* most succeeds when it leans into those elements that have helped fuel the success of the MCU -- humor and human connections. The middle portion of the film is its best, in no small part due to the fact that it’s where the movie’s commitment to comic relief is strongest. It finds Diana Prince (Wonder Woman’s “world of man” pseudonym) coming to WWI-era London and puzzling over the hypocrisies and odd conventions of this strange new land.

It’s here that star Gal Gadot does her best work in the film, playing the fish out of water with a combination of bemusement, confusion, and disbelief that makes Wonder Woman’s transition from a mythic queendom to scrubby London more than just one big scene change. Chris Pine (playing love interest and British spy Steve Trevor) shows off that fast-talking, aggrandizing-yet-self-deprecating charms that made him a nice fit as the heir to William Shatner in *Star Trek*. And the film has a ringer in Lucy Davis (of the original *The Office* fame) to show off her comic chops, along with assists from Trevor’s ragtag group of buddies. This commitment to humor livens the film and makes it easier to warm to its larger, globe-threatening plots.

But *Wonder Woman* also creates a convincing romance between Diana and Steve. The nature of the plot means it’s inevitably a bit rushed, and the closing portion of the film bogs down in trite ruminations on the power of love, but the heart of the film is founded on the relationship between those two people, and it absolutely works. That starts with Pine, who plays a convincing love interest with just enough guile and guts for a warrior to appreciate but just enough charm and wit to make a worth foil. But it ends with Gadot, who convincingly portrays the determined warrior warming to her guide to the world of man, and being pained by those harrowing moments when he is in danger. That fact alone makes them the two most compelling characters in the DCEU thus far, and the ones with best developed and most engaging inner lives.

That’s an important ingredient in the film, because *Wonder Woman* tends to falter when the two are not together in the story. The opening act of the film largely centers on Themyscira, Diana’s Greek myth-inspired homeland. It’s there that the film barrels through a fairly tedious origin story, mired in the usual clichés of “I want to fight!”/”No, you’re not ready” done with the generic high fantasy stentorian pattern. Visually, the scenes are impressive, with colorful verdant growth all around, the fluid fighting style of the Amazons, and a brief art shift to deliver backstory. But beyond doing the paint-by-numbers work of establishing Diana’s will to war and deliver exposition and cryptic hints, the film ticks up once she makes it off the island.

But similar issues affect the film in the third act and in its action scenes. When sending Diana into combat, *Wonder Woman* defaults to the DCEU house style. That means antiseptic, undifferentiated action, filled with breakneck cuts and a lack of choreographic continuity. The film can’t escape the Snyder visual influences in these scenes, and while Snyder’s *300* is not a bad reference point for the mayhem of a Grecian warrior, the pre-viz backgrounds and the stop, start and slow tack of the fight scenes tend to dull rather than excite. That’s particularly true in the last portion of the film, when *Wonder Woman* meets its quota of CGI-drenched fisticuffs that leave every skirmish feeling like it was plucked out of a video game and deposited into a live action film.

That belies the theme of *Wonder Woman*, and Diana’s arc in the film -- that war is not a glorious or simple thing, but rather a complex source of grief, one not so giving of laurels nor easy to end or comprehend.

** *Caution: The remainder of this review contains major spoilers for Wonder Woman.* **

To that end, the cleverest part of the film is its third-act turn. After Diana kills General Ludendorff, the German commander she believes to be Ares, the god of war, in disguise, having cursed mankind with propensity for violence and conflict, she is shocked that the fighting nevertheless continues. It’s then than Ares emerges, in the form of Sir Patrick Morgan (David Thewlis, best known as Professor Lupin from the *Harry Potter* franchise), a member of England’s Imperial War Cabinet who spoke in favor of an armistice, revealing that it was only to prolong the broader conflict between nations.

It’s here that *Wonder Woman* reveals more complexity under the hood. Diana’s journey, from believing that war and by extension, evil, are a personified force that can be slain and thus defeated in black and white terms, to understanding that Ares had been pulling strings on both sides of this conflict and that the causes of such devastation are more complicated, is a sound one. Ares’s initial taunts and temptations prove the most convincing vehicle for this theme. And it provides an interesting arc for Diana, giving her a genuine coming of age story that helps grow the character.

The problem comes when the inevitable clash of titans arises and Ares words go from sounding like the honey-dripped promises and reassurances of the devil on your shoulder to the generic boasts and declarations of your bog standard movie villain. As soon as *Wonder Woman* embraces the complexity of its theme, it dumbs it down to the usual good and evil aphorisms.

That same issue extends to the film’s contemplation of, and its main character coming to terms with, the nature of humanity. At times, the film uses a light touch. There are hints in the brief stories of prejudice and oppression from Trevor’s friends Sameer (Saïd Taghmaoui) and Chief (Eugene Brave Rock) that the evil that lies in the hearts of men goes far beyond any god of war. And Ares’s own reveal shows the interesting notion that he merely stokes fires already burning in those on both sides of the war, rather than introducing something that wasn’t already there into a pure people.

But again, it devolves into standard bad guy clichés and typical voiceover claptrap about love being able to conquer hate. In that, *Wonder Woman* follows the leads of its DCEU predecessors like *Man of Steel* and *Dawn of Justice* which graze legitimately profound ideas but can never quite nail them down, and lose them entirely in the perfunctory climactic maelstrom.

Still, by any measure, *Wonder Woman* is a big step forward, both for D.C.’s efforts to establish a cinematic universe made up of worthwhile films, and for the cause of greater balance in the superhero genre on the silver screen. The movie is far from perfect, suffering from many of the same problems that dulled the impact of its fellow DCEU flicks. But in its humor, its heart, and who it chooses to tell a story about, it breaks away from those limiting issues and charts exciting new territory, both for this series of films and for comic book movies as a whole.', '2017-06-04 19:45:50.000000000', 'NEUTRAL', 0.997556542859493, 'https://trakt.tv/comments/129203', null, 0, true, '[ 7 . 2/10 ] To call * Wonder Woman * the best DCEU film is to damn it with faint praise .

I love DC, I love Greek mythology, and Wonder Woman movies are generally the best of both worlds, at least that last animated one was amazing.  So my expectations were sky high after choosing to see this movie, over Alien, The Mummy and others currently at the box office.  I was definitely disappointed, but I really enjoyed the movie.  Just weird.

I wanted more from WW''s mother, first of all, since she was quite amazing in her own right from all the comics and previous movies.  I hated the love affair between WW and Captain Kirk, but I understand why it was so necessary for the plot.  And, mostly, she was basically Captain America in DC form.  Both in WWI, fighting the Germans, with a secret weapon, both on a special covert mission to end the war, both in USA colors wielding a shield to stop bullets and tank rounds, and more.  I disliked the cookie cutter similarities between the Cap and WW.  Lastly, I really disliked the flashbacks, within the flashbacks.  Just start the story from the beginning in the first place!

Now on to the Awesomeness that is the Wonder Woman movie.  Her abilities were top notch.  The superhero aspect was brilliantly captured and portrayed.  The animated version was ported into the real life version flawlessly.  She is by far the best superhero in film, next to, currently deceased, Superman.  Wolverine, Spidey, all the Avengers, Batman, Green Lantern, and anyone else with a movie franchise would easily get bitch slapped by WW.

The sets were ugly, the costumes were ugly, the story/plot had a ugly feel to it.  The ugliness gave such a brilliant contrast to the breathtaking beauty of the star of the movie, Gal Gadot.  I couldn''t take my eyes off her.  Her beauty was unprecedented.  I know she isn''t the most beautiful woman in the world, but this movie made me believe Wonder Woman was.

On the one side, I like it. It was good, and I did enjoy it. But on the other hand it wasn''t what I expected it to be - I had high expectations, I enjoyed the trailers and even though I block myself from reviews before watching and experiencing a movie myself, I did realize that people where loving it. So maybe I also had some really high expectations - I don''t know.

However, the movie did not wow me the way that Man of Steel or even Batman v Superman did. Maybe, those did because MoS I had no expectations at all (I am no Superman fan) and BvS I did not expect to be so much about Batman (I love Batman). Wonder Woman however I do not have any childhood connections to, and never followed her, and her role in BvS wasn''t the best - not because of she was bad, no - but because it was introduced in probably the most unfortunate way.

Taking all movies of the DC Universe into account, Wonder Woman is better than Suicide Squad for sure. However it is worse than both MoS and BvS - so somewhere between 7 and 8, and I actually put it on an 8 beforehand, but thinking a lot about it, I''d rather see it at 7.

The movie starts really great, I love the child Diana actor - and don''t get me wrong: I love what this is doing for small girls who love becoming her, who will dress up like her on Hallween, etc. It''s great! And that alone deservs a good rating. But, looking at the movie from a cinephile perspective, there is again a lot of things that I have to critizise.

What I loved: The fighting scenes, especially in the beginning. They are great - I would have loved it to be R-Rated, a bit more brutal, such as Fox''s Logan - it would have done the movie better. But okey. That''s just a small thing. Bigger however is the missing atmosphere. What I love about MoS and BvS is this dire atmosphere, the hopelessly, which is not only expressed by the story, but which is also aided by the camera work, by the beautifull imagery, by sometimes the shaky cams, etc. In Wonder Woman, which is set in the First World War, which is discussed as one of the most horrible wars we''ve ever experienced, when it comes to brutallity, mortallity, and the way the war was fought (trenches and gas attacks, etc.), we should ge a dire atmosphere as well. However, what we actually are presented with jokes, with silly characters, etc. All these things take some of the seriousness of the entire situation and that also affects the credibility of the entire situation. I cannot believe that Wonder Woman is so touched by the wouded people, for example - yes she wants to fight, she was born for this, she feels this to be her purpose - no question. But then she''s war/fighting hungry - and that is okey. But her feeling shocked when seeing the wounded? She feeling the need for helping those people freeing their village? I don''t feel that, when seeing it. They are saying it, but it''s not credibil, especially if it was said between two jokes.

That is not me saying I didn''t like any of the jokes - especially in the beginnig they where somewhat nice, and put her in an interesting spot, because on the one side she seems like the strong, unapproachable and unrelatable fearless godlike warrior; but giving her being thrown in a world she doesn''t know and doesn''t understand making her appear even naive in some situation, that on the other hand makes her relatable, makes her cute and funny in the same time. And I enjoyed these two contraries.

Another thing killing the amtosphere was the sometimes overdone action. [spoiler]I mean, seriouly: She jumpes into the window of a church tower and the whole building collapses? Why doesn''t she jump all the time and by doing so invoke some earthquakes killing all the enemies?[/spoiler] Not only does she sometimes show powers unmatchable and therefore breaking the mood: She also seems unbreakable. She never takes a scratch, she''s never tired, never wounded, never in doubt, nothing. She''s even hardly in pain about loosing some of her loved ones. And that makes all the action irrelevant, because you know that she will never be overpowerd in any situation. That''s what Marvel is doing and that''s what set the frist DC movies appart: We had Superman, who is fighting an inner conflict by protecting those who are fighting him, and we have Batman, who is broken because of his past - we have heroes that are wounded, that bleed, that can actually die and this makes it even more interesting to watch, more thrilling, more realistic and relevant.

And then - this is probably just me, but actually I hate it when Germans are played by English actors, and the only way you realize that they are Germans is because they speak in an accent. Why? We are in the Post-Inglorious Basterds era, where Tarantino had shown us, how great movies can become when you do them multilingual. The French speak French? The woman in the Trench spoke something (that I did not recognize)? We had Italian, we had Chinese. And we hat a lot of fun with different British Accents used in this movie. Hell, they even made all the other Amazones speak a Israeli accent, so that it doesn''t sound weird that Gal Gadot had one - that is intelligent script writing! But why then not have the Germans speak Geramn? Makes a movie so much more fun to watch. It is of course just a minor thing, but it adds to the list.

So up to now I listed everything wrong with this movie - however not everything is. I think the acting was great - I am not a fan of Gal Gadot, but I think in the role of Wonder Woman she has mad her best performance yet. She fits perfectly into this role and I cannot imagine any other actress that can fill this movie with both, the power of an fearless strong female lead, who at the same time keeps her feminine features, and who has the right amount of sexiness without it being too much, sexist, etc. And I also liked Chris Pine - he is just about right, without being too much, and also fits perfectly into his role. Also I enjoyed the fighting scenes - they really maxed out everything they could - being an R-Rated movie this still looks absolutely stunning and great and just makes a lot of fun.
I also found the story to be reasonable, it is really good, you can follow throuhg and find every step making absolutely sens (lessons learned from Suicide Squad wich in that department was aweful). And somehow it does rectify her role in BvS - I do believe that when rewatching BvS, I will like her character - I will not think "okey, where did she come from and who the hack is she and why is she there all of a sudden and helping them" - no. This scenes now will actually make total sense - I am sure of it, and I am looking forward to rewatching BvS.

As it goes for the DC Universe: I hope that Justice League will be a little bit more back to the DC roots, but I am looking forward to it - I love that DC is having a great success here and that finally they work and effort will pay off (after the not so well received BvS and the horrible critics on Suicide Squad, I was fearing a bit for them; I am especially keen on the single Batman movie. I want it to happen!). But I hope that they will also recognize that the main reason is that we have the first female comic hero lead that is captured on canvas. I loved their style thus far, with Suicide Squad one could see that they where adopting Marvels style and that did not pay out. This one has it''s flaws aswell and it does not mean to put back more comedy into the movies and take away their seriousness.

- Cinematography.

- Too long.

Bringing to life such a multi-layered character requires passion and a keen eye for detail. Her love for WW,and also for film making, is so evident in this movie. This just proves that not only male directors can drive a tentpole movie of this scale. Diversity is still a big issue in Hollywood and it''s sad that Patty had never done a movie since Monster. She''s one of the most talented and smart directors out there. And I''m really glad that it was her who brought Wonder Woman to life. I really hope that Warner Bros lock her down. Give her any movie she wants to do, coz she earned it. I cannot praise her more for giving us a movie that will stand the test of time. This is a triumph not only for Wonder Woman but for film in general.

Gal''s Wonder Woman journey wasn''t at all smooth sailing. She had been often criticized for her lack of acting prowess. But Gal landing the coveted role was maybe a gift from the gods themselves. Prior to getting the part, she was supposed to play the female badass in Man of Steel, Faora Ul. But alas, she had to drop out due to her pregnancy. Zack and co. should be very proud of this casting choice. They''ve found the Wonder Woman for this generation. I cannot see anyone other than Gal playing WW, just like I can''t see another Tony Stark or Logan played by someone else. She fully embodies WW. She can be both a warrior and a person full of compassion in a sec, which is the true definition of Wonder Woman. She IS Wonder Woman.

As for the supporting characters, Chris Pine was great. His chemistry with Gal is one of the key elements of this movie. The Amazons were all breathtaking and strong. I hope we can see more of them in the future. Steve''s pals were fantastic especially Etta and Sameer. The villains was so-so but they''ve served their purpose, and the twist about Ares was not something you could''ve anticipated( unless you frequent reddit)

But the true magic that WW leaves after you watched it, is that sense of optimism. I have never experienced that in any superhero movies, or just movies in general.

I''m actually quite surprised by this, but glad at the same time. DC didn''t have such a great start with it''s previous installments and while I''m still anxious about the next upcoming films, I can safely say that "Wonder Woman" is the first decent film in the DC Universe.

The two stand outs of the film are Gal Gadot and Chris Pine. Both the chemistry and the performances were all solid. You love seeing them together and hate to see something bad come between them, which always ends tragically. I wasn''t a huge fan of Gal Gadot performance and character in "Batman V Superman", as it didn''t fit in the already crowed movie and isn''t in the best hands. Here it''s better in terms of direction.

"Wonder Woman" is a massive improvement and am very happy DC listened. The action scenes were exciting and well made. It''s colorful and has a great message for empowerment for both women &amp; men. Without the painfully obvious re-shoots and no Kanye West songs or Queen Bohemian Rhapsody thrown in for "improvements". The movie is at least watchable and enjoyable. And get this, it''s got a sense of humor, even when some of it didn''t hit the mark.

While I liked the movie overall, however I didn''t quite love it like everyone else. My issues are with the first act being sluggish and filled with cliche digoule. Soon as Chris Pine shows up is when it picked up for me, as you get some great scenes between Steve and Diana.

The film had a great message about war and how everyone is a mix of good and bad; which sadly gets ruined in the third act and turns into "Man of Steel" climax all over again. Pretty disappointing. And I didn''t like Wonder Woman theme (which is rock music) playing while the story is set in WW1. It just felt odd and out of place hearing rock music during that type of era, but that''s my opinion.

I don''t know who does the visual effects for the DC movies, because it doesn''t look that good and very unfinished. I mean, some of it looked decent when it''s not against real life environment, although that can''t be said for the rest.

The movie also suffers from the same problem with Marvel and that''s the villains. Talk about cartoonist at it''s worse and just stereotypical. Just be glad it isn''t as bad as enchantress.

Overall rating: Wow, it may look like I named off more problems than positives. Keep in mind I really did like the movie, these are just things that bugged me and could have done better. The rest I thought was good and I''m interested in where things are going in the future for these movies.

First of all, this movie only made money because it''s a superhero movie, don''t get me wrong, I love superhero movies and i wanted to like Wonder Woman, but I just can''t get aboard the hype train.

**Here''s why this movie sucks on its own merits:**

Movie part:

-For a superhero movie the CGI was horribly bad (they were also poorly edited). It is so obvious. I kept wondering if this movie was made in the early 2000''s!!!
How poorly can such an expensive movie use such bad camera angles in front of something as simple as a green screen? and every action scene was in slow motions! you can''t do that!!!

-The first half of the movie was sooo slow I had to hold my eyes open to prevent me from falling asleep, then the rest i couldn''t make sense of the movie and I really don''t think the writers knew either.
Wonder Woman stumbles through the movie like a naive 15 year old imbecile who hasn''t hit puberty yet., she''s a goddess for crying out loud (I know they tried to make it obvious she was a stranger to the World she just entered, but for love og Gods they didn''t have to make her stupid!!), [spoiler] the logic for not telling her who she really is, screwed up the movie . The way she kills Ares at the end, could have been achieved by telling her who she really was earlier, [/spoiler] granted, it would have been a short movie but better.

-And me-Wow, she can talk different languages such superhero powers very amazing!
I don''t get why they tried to make it so obvious, they could have focused on something else.

-i didn''t get why they had to show different races so obviously i mean, come on skirt, hat,... Are we 8?

Gal Gadot part:

-First of all, she was not a good choice for WW,  physically amazon ladies are not stick thin models surviving on a lettuce leaf diet.
and i dont get why everyone was praising the "Israeli actress" ,She had this weird accent and when she talked, she did this extra head movement which looked ridiculous. also bad bad acting oh my god.

-It seemed like Gal Gadot was constantly posing for a photo shoot instead of acting!!
I don’t know if it was all the feminists that boosted the rating of this movie, if it was… that’s extremely sad.


Logic/mythology:

[spoiler] -WW''s aunt sacrifices her life so that WW doesn''t get shot from behind early in the movie. Later in the movie the villain tells her she''s a god and only a god can kill a god. This renders her aunt''s sacrifice an act of suicide because the movie went out of its way to tell the audience that all the Amazon Women knew she was a god. [/spoiler]

[spoiler] -WW''s mom, the queen, tells everyone not to do something only to have everyone disobey her. Not just once, but EVERY time she says don''t do something, someone does exactly the opposite. I.E. Don''t train my daughter to fight, don''t let this guy leave the island, don''t go with the guy leaving the island. [/spoiler]

[spoiler] -Zeus creates the Amazons to defeat Ares. In actual mythology, the tribe of Amazons were the offspring of, wait for it.... Ares and Harmonia - a nymph. So, Ares is WW''s father, not brother. Yup!
Then Zeus, creates a child of his to serve as a weapon against Ares to save mankind, Wonder Women. Really? [/spoiler] This sounds odd and forced in a Greek setting.

Humor:

-They dedicated a continuous 15-20 min segment and it all stems from the cultural differences between the Amazonians and humans. The bath scene (**Average man!** if only this part was done by a woman and we had all hell broke loose), sleeping in the boat, the secretary, the clothes trials... all stems from the same issue. It''s the same material stretched for 15 mins

Music:

Movie part : -For a superhero movie the CGI was horribly bad ( they were also poorly edited ) . It is so obvious . I kept wondering if this movie was made in the early 2000 '' s !!! How poorly can such an expensive movie use such bad camera angles in front of something as simple as a green screen ? and every action scene was in slow motions ! you can '' t do that !!! -The first half of the movie was sooo slow I had to hold my eyes open to prevent me from falling asleep , then the rest i couldn '' t make sense of the movie and I really don '' t think the writers knew either . Wonder Woman stumbles through the movie like a naive 15 year old imbecile who hasn '' t hit puberty yet ., she '' s a goddess for crying out loud ( I know they tried to make it obvious she was a stranger to the World she just entered , but for love og Gods they didn '' t have to make her stupid !! ) , [ spoiler ] the logic for not telling her who she really is , screwed up the movie . The way she kills Ares at the end , could have been achieved by telling her who she really was earlier , [/spoiler ] granted , it would have been a short movie but better . -And me-Wow , she can talk different languages such superhero powers very amazing ! I don '' t get why they tried to make it so obvious , they could have focused on something else . -i didn '' t get why they had to show different races so obviously i mean , come on skirt , hat ,... Are we 8 ? Gal Gadot part : -First of all , she was not a good choice for WW , physically amazon ladies are not stick thin models surviving on a lettuce leaf diet . and i dont get why everyone was praising the " Israeli actress " , She had this weird accent and when she talked , she did this extra head movement which looked ridiculous . also bad bad acting oh my god . -It seemed like Gal Gadot was constantly posing for a photo shoot instead of acting !! I don ’ t know if it was all the feminists that boosted the rating of this movie , if it was … that ’ s extremely sad . Logic/mythology : [ spoiler ] -WW '' s aunt sacrifices her life so that WW doesn '' t get shot from behind early in the movie . Later in the movie the villain tells her she '' s a god and only a god can kill a god . This renders her aunt '' s sacrifice an act of suicide because the movie went out of its way to tell the audience that all the Amazon Women knew she was a god . [/spoiler ]

[ spoiler ] -WW '' s mom , the queen , tells everyone not to do something only to have everyone disobey her . Not just once , but EVERY time she says don '' t do something , someone does exactly the opposite . I . E . Don '' t train my daughter to fight , don '' t let this guy leave the island , don '' t go with the guy leaving the island . [/spoiler ]

[ spoiler ] -Zeus creates the Amazons to defeat Ares . In actual mythology , the tribe of Amazons were the offspring of , wait for it .... Ares and Harmonia - a nymph . So , Ares is WW '' s father , not brother . Yup ! Then Zeus , creates a child of his to serve as a weapon against Ares to save mankind , Wonder Women . Really ? [/spoiler ] This sounds odd and forced in a Greek setting . Humor : -They dedicated a continuous 15-20 min segment and it all stems from the cultural differences between the Amazonians and humans . The bath scene (** Average man ! ** if only this part was done by a woman and we had all hell broke loose ) , sleeping in the boat , the secretary , the clothes trials ... all stems from the same issue . It '' s the same material stretched for 15 mins Music : Not bad . Not memorable either . in other word , Meh . ** Overall , this is a bad movie , made not to entertain but a quick money maker with main selling point : " Female Lead " . Very overrated .

I''m a fan of all the Marvel series, but this is just a slap in the face to all the fans. How it got above a 5 on IMDB is beyond me.

1) The plot. Just dumb.
2) The A-team. What was their purpose? Comical relief? WW did everything herself. They were introduced with the assumption that each had some special skill that they can contribute. If terrible singing and hitting on women is a skill, any average drunk could have been part of this team. And what the hell is up with the indian?  He''s the whitest indian I''ve ever seen.
3) Lazy script writing. At one scene WW loses her sword. Next scene she has the sword while Aries patiently waited for her to retrieve it. Seriously?
4) Why did Steve need to fly the plane at the end to blow it and himself up? They could have just blown it up where it was to begin with. No need to sacrifice himself. As much destruction that Aries brought to that area, the extra explosion from the plane would not have made a difference.
5) For being super fighters, the Amazon women died pretty fast from bullets. So basically they have no special abilities and are just some hot women that can shoot arrows.
6) After Aries dies, everyone is hugging and the war is over. But we all know that there are plenty of other wars in the future. So that didn''t make any sense at all.
7) The A-team was fighting a sniper and risked their lives to pick up and lift a heavy piece of metal to make WW jump in the air to destroy the enemy sniper. As much destruction as she can deal, she did not need their help to jump an extra two feet.
8) For being a god, Aries got his ass kicked by WW. The fight should have been more evenly matched.
9) Acting. WW is hot. That''s it. She''s a terrible actress in this movie.
10) For being a spy/government agency, they let WW walk into the discussion room without any identity check. They only reason they kicked her out was because she was a WOMAN! I mean WTF!
11) No blood. At any point. Getting stabbed, shot, sliced, blown up. No blood. The sword went through someone, no blood.

Actually, come to think of it, it''s not beyond me. I wouldn''t put it past studios to use spam accounts and fake reviews to build up something that simply isn''t there. It''s a shame cause the appearance of WW in BvS was one of the highlights of that movie, she held her own next to the Bat and Superman and left people hoping she''ll do the same in her stand alone movie.

She doesn''t.

The only aspects of the movie that resonated was Diana''s ignorance of the world beyond her home. Peeling the veil beyond the idyllic world she was raised in with the cold harsh reality of the real world offered an abundance of opportunities to explore her character, the world as it was at the time and social topics that are still very relevant. Why is mankind self destructive, can we change and most importantly, equality of sexes. The movie drops the ball on all of them by either reducing those aspects to trivial scenes designed to invoke a cheap giggle or overly dramatic cliche ridden contrived moments that make you roll your eyes.

Although it looks good enough, screenplay, directing and pacing are all over the place. Save one action scene that takes place on the western front and has some structure to it (btw, that''s also one of the few moments a genuine moral and emotional conflict is brought up but like the rest of the movie left unfulfilled) actions scenes are typical present day CGI fests, nothing unseen.

What wraps up the beating of the dead horse are Pine''s acting chops that only serve to highlight Gadot''s lack thereof. This otherwise lovely and charming lady was in plenty of movies in recent years, some of the franchises were quite successful (unfortunately), but there was always a reason she never took off. You''ll call me sexist and whatnot but something tells me I''m not the first nor the last one to notice her lack of talent. Putting someone like her next to Connie Nielsen, Robin Wright, Chris Pine, Danny Houston, even Ewen Bremner and Elena Anaya with their limited screen time, she simply can''t hold her own.

All those things added up result with a mediocre movie that''s been hyped beyond belief to go along with the current climate of appeasement and send a "strong woman" message. They should have taken some hints from the Bride, Ellen Ripley, Sarah Connor or the like. They had talented actresses playing well written characters, none of which is present in WW.

Anyways, that''s where I''m at with this mess.

When I learned that Zack Snyder had his fingers in it I got a worried since he recently wrote such atrocities as Batman vs Superman and sure enough the story is a really the weakest part of the movie. A typical nonsensical, unintelligent, Hollywood story/script were you are better off putting your brain in idle when watching it.

However it makes up for this with cool special effects and, surprisingly, quite enjoyable characters. This is definitely a movie that you watch for the sake of the special effects. Well, if you are a male teenager you might also be watching it to drool over Gal Gadot of course (I have to admit that she is hot).

There is not too much to say about the plot. Our Amazon hot chick discovers that there is a war going on and goes out to stop it. Since she has been overly protected by her guardian she is amazingly clueless about life outside of her little island. Especially aspects involving men. Something which creates some funny moments as well as some embarrassingly silly ones. This, Diana’s gradual evolution where she not only is learning about life but also discovers her considerable powers, is one of the enjoyable aspects of the movie though. It is of course also one of the dummer aspects of the movie. How the f… could the Amazon Queen race Diana to be so ignorant about everything?

Another not so enjoyable part of the movie is the ludicrous scenes where the britts are trying to obtain peace at all costs as well as the stereotypical portrayal of Ludendorff as some megalomaniacal, half crazy war-mongerer. This was just dumb. I guess Zac Snyder just picked the name out of some history book without bothering to read up on the character. Typical lack of intelligence and respect, a la Hollywood, for anything outside of their, very limited, sphere of knowledge.
Well, at least Danny Huston did a pretty decent job of the shitty role he was given. So did most of the rest of actors. I definitely liked Gal Gadot as Super Woman but then, although I am not a teenager, I am still a male so maybe I am biased when it comes to her?

I definitely liked the special effects. The showdown at the end was great as far as I am concerned and the rest not bad either. They could have been even better though if it would not have been so obvious that the Germans where mostly incompetent extras waiting for Wonder Woman to show off her gymnastics and slow motion abilities. Come on, even superhero special effects should make some pretense of being “realistic” superhero special effects.

The movie is definitely aimed at the young adult segment. Unfortunately it do not seem to know what it is aiming for. Sometimes it is almost adult, sometimes it is late teen and sometimes just so bloody TV-show silly that you’re wondering if it is aiming for even pre-teens.

Anyway, regardless of its faults I did enjoy my 2+ hour spent on this movie.
